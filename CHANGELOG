0.2.0.b1
--------

* WorkingHours.is_working_hour() is working now.
* WorkingHours class is moved from stalker.models.project to
  stalker.models.studio module.
* ``daily_working_hours`` attribute is moved from
  stalker.models.project.Project to stalker.models.studio.Studio class.
* Repository path variables now ends with a forward slash even if it is not
  given.
* Updated Project classes validation messages to correlate with Stalker
  standard.
* Implementation of the Studio class is finished. The scheduling works like a
  charm.
* Added dialogCreator.js which helps creating a dialog without having a widget
  (Button or MenuItem) calling it and updated dialogCaller.js to use
  dialogCreator while creating a dialog.
* It is now possible to use any characters in SimpleEntity.name and the derived
  classes.
* jQueryGantt:
  * Fix; t is now possible to correctly move a TaskBar without getting in to
    an infinite loop which was freezing the browser.
  * The timing resolution of jQueryGantt is now 1 hour.
  * Fix; GanttMaster.task_ids were not properly cleaned in GanttMaster.reset(),
    resulting wrong links to be created.
  * Added a new zoom level where it is possible to see the every 1 hour of 1
    day.
  * Colorized the Sunday column in suitable zoom levels. In upcoming releases
    it will use the stalker.models.studio.Studio.working_hours attribute to
    determine if the day/hour is an off day/hour.
  * Disabled editing of date fields.
  * Disabled undo/redo queue for performance test.
  * Fixed vertical overflow in gantt chart.
  * It is now possible to not to align a tasks start to its dependent tasks
    end.

  inside the related tab on the Project Page.
* Booking class is renamed to TimeLog.

0.2.0.a10
---------

* jQueryGantt:
  * jQueryGantt is now using the Task ids coming from Stalker instead of the
    ridiculous rowId.
  * Fixed a lot of issues related with the new data structure, it seems
    everything is working properly right now.
  * Parent Tasks displayed differently than the leaf tasks (on paar with the
    other gantt charts).
  * Gantt chart in User Detail page is now showing the parent tasks of the
    tasks of the user.
  * Now there are two different context menus for container/parent tasks and
    leaf tasks.
* Added new attribute to WorkingHours class called ``weekly_working_hours``,
  which calculates the weekly working hours based on the working hours defined
  in the instance.
* Updated the Create Task Dialog to reflect the TaskJuggler integration.
* Task class now has a new attribute called ``schedule_timing`` which is
  replacing the ``effort``, ``length`` and ``duration`` attributes. Together
  with the ``schedule_model`` attribute it will be used in scheduling the Task.
* Updated the config system to the one used in oyProjectManager (based on
  Sphinx config system). Now to reach the defaults::
    
    # instead of doing the following
    from stalker.conf import defaults # not valid anymore
    
    # use this
    from stalker import defaults
  
  If the above idiom is used, the old ``defaults`` module behaviour is
  retained, so no code change is required other than the new lower case config
  variable names.

0.2.0.a9
--------

* A new property called ``to_tjp`` added to the SimpleEntity class which needs
  to be implemented in the child and is going to be used in TaskJuggler
  integration.
* A new attribute called ``is_scheduled`` added to Task class and it is going
  to be used in Gantt charts. Where it will lock the class and will not try
  to snap it to anywhere if it is scheduled.
* Changed the ``resolution`` attribute name to ``timing_resolution`` to comply
  with TaskJuggler.
* ScheduleMixin:
  * Updated ScheduleMixin class documentation.
  * There are two new read-only attributes called ``computed_start`` and
    ``computed_end``. These attributes will be used in storing of the values
    calculated by TaskJuggler, and will be used in Gantt Charts if available.
  * Added ``computed_duration``.
* Task:
  * Arranged the TaskJuggler workflow.
  * The task will use the effort > length > duration attributes in `to_tjp`
    property.
* Changed the license of Stalker from BSD-2 to LGPL 2.1. Any version previous
  to 0.2.0.a9 will be still BSD-2 and any version from and including 0.2.0.a9
  will be distributed under LGPL 2.1 license.
* Added new types of classes called Schedulers which are going to be used in
  scheduling the tasks.
* Added TaskJugglerScheduler, it uses the given project and schedules its
  tasks.

0.2.0.a8
--------

* TagSelect now can be filled by setting its ``value`` attribute (Ex:
  TagSelect.set('value', data))
* Fixed Projects menu in base.jinja2, the link is now updating correctly when a
  new project is added.
* Added a new method called ``is_root`` to Task class. It is true for tasks
  where there are no parents.
* Added a new attribute called ``users`` to the Department class which is a
  synonym for the ``members`` attribute.
* Task:
  * Task class is now preventing one of the dependents to be set as the parent
    of a task.
  * Task class is now preventing one of the parents to be set as the one of the
    dependents of a task.
  * Fixed ``autoflush`` bugs in Task class.
* Fixed `admin` users department initialization.
* Added ``thumbnail`` attribute to the SimpleEntity class which is a reference
  to a Link instance, showing the path of the thumbnail.
* Fixed Circular Dependency bug in Task class, where a parent of a newly
  created task is depending to another task which is set as the dependee for
  this newly created task (T1 -> T3 -> T2 -> T1 (parent relation) -> T3 -> T2
  etc.).
* jQueryGantt: Moving any child task will adjust the parent start and end dates
  so they fit to the children.

0.2.0.a7
--------

* Changed these default setting value names to corresponding new names:
  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_DURATION`` -> ``TASK_DURATION``
  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_PRIORITY`` -> ``TASK_PRIORITY``
  * ``DEFAULT_VERSION_TAKE_NAME`` -> ``VERSION_TAKE_NAME``
  * ``DEFAULT_TICKET_LABEL`` -> ``TICKET_LABEL``
  * ``DEFAULT_ACTIONS`` -> ``ACTIONS``
  * ``DEFAULT_BG_COLOR`` -> ``BG_COLOR``
  * ``DEFAULT_FG_COLOR`` -> ``FG_COLOR``
* stalker.conf.defaults:
  * Added default settings for project working hours (``WORKING_HOURS``,
    ``DAY_ORDER``, ``DAILY_WORKING_HOURS``)
  * Added a new variable for setting the task time resolution called
    ``TIME_RESOLUTION``.
* stalker.models.project.Project:
  * Removed Project.project_tasks attribute, use Project.tasks directly to get
    all the Tasks in that project. For root task you can do a quick query::
      
      Task.query.filter(Task.project==proj_id).filter(Task.parent==None).all()
    
    This will also return the Assets, Sequences and Shots in that project,
    which are also Tasks.
  * Users are now assigned to Projects by appending them to the Project.users
    list. This is done in this way to allow a reduced list of resources to be
    shown in the Task creation dialogs.
  * Added a new helper class for Project working hour management, called
    WorkingHours.
  * Added a new attribute to Project class called ``working_hours`` which holds
    stalker.models.project.WorkingHours instances to manage the Project working
    hours. It will directly be passed to TaskJuggler.
* stalker.models.task.Task:
  * Removed the Task.task_of attribute, use Task.parent to get the owner of
    this Task.
  * Task now has two new attributes called Task.parent and Task.children which
    allow more complex Task-to-Task relation.
  * Secondary table name for holding Task to Task dependency relation is
    renamed from ``Task_Tasks`` to ``Task_Dependencies``.
  * _check_circular_dependency function is now accepting a third argument which
    is the name of the attribute to be investigated for circular relationship.
    It is done in that way to be able to use the same function in searching for
    circular relations both in parent/child and depender/dependee relations.
* ScheduleMixin:
  * Added a new attribute to ScheduleMixin for time resolution adjustment.
    Default value is 1 hour and can be set with
    stalker.conf.defaults.TIME_RESOLUTION. Any finer time than the resolution
    is rounded to the closest multiply of the resolution. It is possible to set
    it from microseconds to years. Although 1 hour is a very reasonable
    resolution which is also the default resolution for TaskJuggler.
  * ScheduleMixin now uses datetime.datetime for the start and end attributes.
  * Renamed the ``start_date`` attribute to ``start``.
  * Renamed the ``end_date`` attribute to ``end``
* Removed the TaskableEntity.
* Asset, Sequence and Shot classes are now derived from Task class allowing
  more complex Task relation combined with the new parent/child relation of
  Tasks. Use Asset.children or Asset.tasks to reach the child tasks of that
  asset (same with Sequence and Shot classes).
* stalker.models.shot.Shot:
  * Removed the sequence and introduced sequences attribute in Shot class. Now
    one shot can be in more than one Sequence. Allowing more complex
    Shot/Sequence relations..
  * Shots can now be created without a Sequence instance. The sequence
    attribute is just used to group the Shots.
  * Shots now have a new attribute called ``scenes``, holding Scene instances.
    It is created to group same shots occurring in the same scenes.
* In tests all the Warnings are now properly handled as Warnings.
* stalker.models.ticket.Ticket:
  * Ticket instances are now tied to Projects and it is now possible to create
    Tickets without supplying a Version. They are free now.
  * It is now possible to link any SimpleEntity to a Ticket.
  * The Ticket Workflow is now fully customizable. Use
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_WORKFLOW dictionary to define the workflow and
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_STATUS_ORDER for the order of the ticket
    statuses.
* Added a new class called ``Scene`` to manage Shots with another property.
* Removed the ``output_path`` attribute in FilenameTemplate class.
* Grouped the templates for each entity under a directory with the entity name.
* Converted the ``view.py`` to a python module and put the views for each
  entity to its own python file.

0.2.0.a6
--------

* Added a new Dojo Widget called Tag to help the creation of the tags in the
  TagSelect.
* Users now can have more than one Department.
* Updated java scripts to be `required` in Dojo AMD way.
* Updated setup.py to include "pyramid_jinja2"
* User instances now have two new properties for getting the user tickets
  (User.tickets) and the open tickets (User.open_tickets).
* New shortcut Task.project returns the Task.task_of.project value.
* Added 'PlaceHolder' property for 'FilterSelect Widgets'. And 'Label' property
  is used in construction of 'PlaceHolder' property.
* Set disabled prerequisite fields, until their prerequisite is selected.
* Added 'StartDate', 'EndDate' and 'Duration' field to add_project page.
  'StartDate', 'EndDate' properties are written on database.
* jQueryGannt:
  * Gannt view is now communicating with Stalker correctly. The only left issue
    is the end date value is not properly shown in the gannt view.
  * Updated the jQueryGannt css's to work with Stalker and Dojo.
*  Project page is redesigned. SplitContainer is removed. All contents are
   displayed in TabContainer. New Contents in TabContainer are:
    * ProjectName (Disabled Field - Used for displaying projectname.)
    * Overview  (It has InlineEditable fields. Although they are not connected
      to DB.)
* Shot and Asset creation dialogs now automatically updated with the given
  Project instance info.
* User overview page is now reflection the new design.

0.2.0.a5
--------

* The ``code`` attribute of the SimpleEntity is now introduced as a separate
  mixin. To let it be used by the classes it is really needed.
* The ``query`` method is now converted to a property so it is now possible to
  use it like a property as in the SQLAlchemy.orm.Session as shown below::
    
    from stalker import Project
    Project.query.all() # instead of Project.query().all()

* ScheduleMixin.due_date is renamed to ScheduleMixin.end_date.
* Added a new class attribute to SimpleEntity called ``__auto_name__`` which
  controls the naming of the instances and instances derived from SimpleEntity.
  If ``__auto_name__`` is set to True the ``name`` attribute of the instance
  will be automatically generated and it will have the following format::
    
    {{ClassName}}_{{UUID4}}
    
  Here are a couple of naming examples::
    
    Ticket_74bb46b0-29de-4f3e-b4e6-8bcf6aed352d
    Version_2fa5749e-8cdb-4887-aef2-6d8cec6a4faa

* Fixed an autoflush issue with SQLAlchemy in StatusList class. Now the status
  column is again not nullable in StatusMixin.
* The WebUI form fields are now refreshed with newly added data.
* Added a new Dojo widget called TagSelect. Which is basically a widget for
  adding Tag style widgets.

0.2.0.a4
--------

* Added a new class called EntityType to hold all the available class names and
  capabilities.
* Version class now has a new attribute called ``inputs`` to hold the inputs of
  the current Version instance. It is a list of Link instances.
* FilenameTemplate classes ``path`` and ``filename`` attributes are no more
  converted to string, so given a non string value will raise TypeError.
* Structure.custom_template now only accepts strings and None, setting it to
  anything else will raise a TypeError.
* Two Type's for FilenameTemplate's are created by default when initializing
  the database, first is called "Version" and it is used to define
  FilenameTemplates which are used for placing Version source files. The second
  one is called "Reference" and it is used when injecting references to a given
  class. Along with the FilenameTemplate.target_entity_type this will allow one
  to create two different FilenameTemplates for one class::
    
    # first get the Types
    vers_type = Type.query()\
                .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
                .filter_by(type="Version")\
                .first()
    
    ref_type = Type.query()\
               .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
               .filter_by(type="Reference")\
               .first()
    
    # lets create a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Version files.
    f_ver = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=vers_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/{{task.type.code}}",
        filename="{{asset.code}}_{{version.take_name}}_{{task.type.code}}_v{{'%03d'|version.version_number}}{{link.extension}}"
        output_path="{{version.path}}/Outputs/{{version.take_name}}"
    )
    
    # and now define a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Reference files.
    # no need to have an output_path here...
    f_ref = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=ref_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/References",
        filename="{{link.type.code}}/{{link.id}}{{link.extension}}"
    )

* stalker.db.register() now accepts only real classes instead of class names.
  This way it can store more information about classes.
* Status.bg_color and Status.fg_color attributes are now simple integers. And
  the Color class is removed.
* StatusMixin.status is now a ForeignKey to a the Statuses table, thus it is a
  real Status instance instead of an integer showing the index of the Status in
  the related StatusList. This way the Status of the object will not change if
  the content of the StatusList is changed.
* Added new attribute Project.project_tasks which holds all the direct or
  indirect Tasks created for that project.
* User.login_name is renamed to User.login.
* Removed the ``first_name``, ``last_name`` and ``initials`` attributes from
  User class. Now the ``name`` and ``code`` attributes are going to be used,
  thus the ``name`` attribute is no more the equivalent of ``login`` and the
  ``code`` attribute is doing what was ``initials`` doing previously.

0.2.0.a3
--------

* :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` class now has two new attributes
  :attr:`~stalker.models.status.Status.bg_color` and
  :attr:`~stalker.models.status.Status.fg_color` to hold the UI colors of the
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` instance. The colors are
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Color` instances.

0.2.0.a2
--------

* :class:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity` now has an attribute called
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity.generic_data` which can hold any
  kind of ``SOM`` object inside and it is a list.
* Changed the formatting rules for the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity.name` in
  :class:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity`, now it can start with a number,
  and it is not allowed to have multiple whitespace characters following each
  other.
* The ``source`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.source_file`\ .
* The ``version`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.version_number`\ .
* The ``take`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is renamed
  to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.take_name`\ .
* The :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.version_number` in
  :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is now generated automatically if it
  is skipped or given as None or it is too low where there is already a version
  number for the same Version series (means attached to the same
  :class:`~stalker.models.task.Task` and has the same
  :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.take_name`).
* Moved the :class:`~stalker.models.auth.User` class to
  :mod:`~stalker.models.auth` module.
* Removed the ``stalker.ext.auth`` module because it is not necessary anymore.
  Thus the :class:`~stalker.models.auth.User` now handles all the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.auth.User.password` conversions by itself.
* ``PermissionGroup`` is renamed back to :class:`~stalker.models.auth.Group`
  again to match with the general naming of the authorization concept.
* Created two new classes for the Authorization system, first one is called
  :class:`~stalker.models.auth.Permission` and the second one is a Mixin which
  is called :class;`~stalker.models.mixins.ACLMixin` which adds ACLs to the
  mixed in class. For now, only the :class;`~stalker.models.auth.User` and
  :class;`~stalker.models.auth.Group` classes are mixed with this mixin by
  default.
* The declarative Base class of SQLAlchemy is now created by binding it to a
  ORMClass (a random name) which lets all the derived class to have a method
  called ``query`` which will bypass the need of calling
  ``DBSession.query(class_)`` but instead just call ``class_.query()``::
    
    from stalker.models.auth import User
    
    user_1 = User.query().filter_by(name='a user name').first()


0.2.0.a1
--------
* Converted the whole system to a Pyramid Web application. If the previous
  implementations investigated, it will be understood that it was only the
  database model of a Web Application.
* Changed the :meth:`~stalker.db.setup` arguments. It is now accepting a
  dictionary instead of just a string to comply with the SQLAlchemy scaffold
  and this dictionary should contain keys for the SQLAlchemy engine setup.
  There is another utility that comes with Pyramid to setup the database under
  the `scripts` folder, it is also working without any problem with
  :mod:`~stalker.db`\ .
* The ``session`` variable is renamed to ``DBSession`` and is now a scopped
  session, so there is no need to use ``DBSession.commit`` it will be handled
  by the system it self.
* Even though the ``DBSession`` is using the Zope Transaction Manager extension
  normally, in the database tests no extension is used because the transaction
  manager was swallowing all errors and it was a little weird to try to catch
  this errors out of the ``with`` block.
* Refactored the code, all the models are now in separate python files, but can
  be directly imported from the main stalker module as shown::
  
    from stalker import User, Department, Task
  
  By using this kind of organization, both development and usage will be eased
  out.
* :attr:`~stalker.models.task.Task.task_of` now only accepts
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.TaskableEntity` instances.
* Updated the examples. It is now showing how to extend SOM correctly. 
* Updated the references to the SOM classes in docstrings and rst files.
* Removed the ``Review`` class. And introduced the much handier
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` class. Now reviewing a data is the
  process of creating Ticket's to that data.
* The database is now initialized with a
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.StatusList` and a couple of
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status`\ es appropriate for
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` instances.
* The database is now initialized with two :class:`~stalker.models.type.Type`
  instances ('Enhancement' and 'Defect') suitable for
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` instances.
* :class:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin` now stores the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status` attribute as an Integer
  showing the index of the :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` in the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status_list` attribute but when
  asked for the value of :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status`
  attribute it will return a proper :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status`
  instance and the attribute can be set with an integer or with a proper
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` instance.
