Stalker Changes
===============

0.2.5.2
=======

* **New:** Task instances now have two new properties called ``path`` and
  ``absolute_path``. As in Version instances, these are the rendered version
  of the related FilenameTemplate object in the related Project. The ``path``
  attribute is Repository root relative and ``absolute_path`` is the absolute
  path including the OS dependent Repository path.

* **Update:** Updated alembic revision with revision number "433d9caaafab" to
  also create Statuses introduced with Stalker v0.2.5.

0.2.5.1
=======

* **Update:** Version.__repr__ results with a more readable string.

* **New:** Added a generalized generator called stalker.models.walk_hierarchy()
  that walks and yields the entities over the given attribute in DFS or BFS
  fashion.

* **New:** Added Task.walk_hierarchy() which iterates over the hierarchy of the
  task. It walks in a breadth first fashion. Use method=0 to walk in depth
  first.

* **New:** Added Task.walk_dependencies() which iterates over the dependencies
  of the task. It walks in a breadth first fashion. Use method=0 to walk in
  depth first.

* **New:** Added Version.walk_hierarchy() which iterates over the hierarchy of
  the version. It walks in a depth first fashion. Use method=1 to walk in
  breadth first.

* **New:** Added Version.walk_inputs() which iterates over the inputs of the
  version. It walks in a depth first fashion. Use method=1 to walk in
  breath first.

* **Update:** stalker.models.check_circular_dependency() function is now using
  stalker.models.walk_hierarchy() instead of recursion over itself, which makes
  it more robust in deep hierarchies.

* **Fix:** db.init() now updates the statuses of already created status lists
  for Task, Asset, Shot and Sequence classes.

0.2.5
=====

* **Update:** ``Revision`` class is renamed to ``Review`` and introduced a
  couple of new attributes.

* **New:** Added a new workflow called "Task Review Workflow". Please see the
  documentation about the new workflow.

* **Update:** Task.responsible attribute is now a list which allows multiple
  responsible to be set for a Task.

* **New:** Because of the new "Task Review Workflow" task statuses which are
  normally created in Stalker Pyramid are now automatically created in Stalker
  database initialization. The new statuses are Waiting For Dependency (WFD),
  Ready To Start (RTS), Work In Progress (WIP), Pending Review (PREV), Has
  Revision (HREV), On Hold (OH), Stopped (STOP) and Completed (CMPL) are all
  used in Task, Asset, Shot and Sequence status lists by default.

* **New:** Because of the new "Task Review Workflow" also a status list for
  Review class is created by default. It contains the Statuses of New (NEW),
  Requested Revision (RREV) and Approved (APP).

* **Fix:** Users.login column is now unique.

* **Update:** Ticket workflow in config is now using the proper status names
  instead of the lower case names of the statuses.

* **New:** Added a new exception called **StatusError** which states the entity
  status is not suitable for the action it is applied to.

* **New:** Studio instance now stores the scheduling state to the database to
  prevent two scheduling process to override each other. It also stores the
  last schedule message and the last schedule date and the id of the user who
  has done the scheduling.

* **New:** The Task Dependency relation is now using an Association Object
  instead of just a Secondary Table. The Task.depends and Task.dependent_of
  attributes are now association_proxies.

  Also added extra parameters like ``dependency_target``, ``gap_timing``,
  ``gap_unit`` and ``gap_model`` to the dependency relation. So all of the
  dependency relations are now able to hold those extra information.

  Updated the task_tjp_template to reflect the details of the dependencies that
  a task has.

* **New:** ScheduleMixin class now has some default class attributes that will
  allow customizations in inherited classes. This is mainly done for
  TaskDependency class and for the gap_timing, gap_unit, gap_model attributes
  which are in fact synonyms of schedule_timing, schedule_unit and
  schedule_model attributes coming from the ScheduleMixin class. So by using
  the __default_schedule_attr_name__ Stalker is able to display error messages
  complaining about gap_timing attribute instead of schedule_timing etc.

* **New:** Updating a task by calling Task.request_revision() will now set the
  TaskDependency.dependency_target to 'onstart' for tasks those are depending
  to the revised task and updated to have a status of DREV, OH or STOP. Thus,
  TaskJuggler will be able to continue scheduling these tasks even if the tasks
  are now working together.

* **Update:** Updated the TaskJuggler templates to make the tjp output a little
  bit more readable.

* **New:** ScheduleMixin now creates more localized (to the mixed in class)
  column and enum type names in the mixed in classes.

  For example, it creates the "TaskScheduleModel" enum type for "Task" class
  and for "TaskDependency" it creates "TaskDependencyGapModel" with the same
  setup following the "{{class_name}}{{attr_name}}Model" template.

  Also it creates "schedule_model" column for Task, and "gap_model" for
  TaskDependency class.

* **Update:** Renamed the "TaskScheduleUnit" enum type name to "TimeUnit"
  in ScheduleMixin.

0.2.4
=====

* **New:** Added new class called ``Revision`` to hold info about Task
  revisions.
* **Update:** Renamed ``ScheduleMixin`` to ``DateRangeMixin``.
* **New:** Added a new mixin called ``ScheduleMixin`` (replacing the old one)
  which adds attributes like ``schedule_timing``, ``schedule_unit``,
  ``schedule_model`` and ``schedule_constraint``.
* **New:** Added ``Task.tickets`` and ``Task.open_tickets`` properties.
* **Update:** Removed unnecessary arguments (project_lead, tasks, watching,
  last_login) from User class.
* **Update:** The ``timing_resolution`` attribute is moved from the
  DateRangeMixin to Studio class. So instances of classes like Project or Task
  will not have their own timing resolution anymore.
* **New:** The Studio instance now overrides the values on stalker.defaults on
  creation and on load, and also the db.setup() function lets the first Studio
  instance that it finds to update the defaults. So it is now possible to use
  ``stalker.defaults`` all the time without worrying about the Studio settings.
* **Update:** The ``Studio.yearly_working_days`` value is now always an
  integer.
* **New:** Added a new method ``ScheduleMixin.least_meaningful_time_unit()`` to
  calculate the most appropriate timing unit and the value of the given seconds
  which represents an interval of time.
  
  So it will convert 3600 seconds to 1 hours, and 8424000 seconds to 1 years if
  it represents working time (as_working_time=True) or 2340 hours if it is
  representing the calendar time.
* **New:** Added a new method to ``ScheduleMixin`` called ``to_seconds()``. The
  ``to_seconds()`` method converts the given schedule info values
  (schedule_timing, schedule_unit, schedule_model) to seconds considering if
  the given schedule_model is work time based ('effort' or 'length') or
  calendar time based ('duration').
* **New:** Added a new method to ``ScheduleMixin`` called ``schedule_seconds``
  which you may recognise from ``Task`` class. What it does is pretty much the
  same as in the Task class, it converts the given schedule info values to
  seconds.
* **Update:** When a TimeLog expands a task, the task schedule info values are
  now expanded by using the least meaningful timing unit.
* **Update:** In DateRangeMixin, when the start, end or duration arguments
  given so that the duration is smaller then the defaults.timing_resolution the
  defaults.timing_resolution will be used as the duration and the end will be
  recalculated by anchoring the start value.
* **New:** Adding a TimeLog to a Task and extending its schedule timing will
  now always use the least meaningful timing unit. So expanding a task from 16
  hours to 18 hours will result a task with 2 days of schedule (considering the
  daily_working_hours = 9).
* **Update:** Moved the ``daily_working_hours`` attribute from Studio class to
  WorkingHours class as it was much related to this one then Studio class. Left
  a property with the same name in the Studio class, so it will still
  function as it was before but there will be no column in the database for
  that attribute anymore.

0.2.3.5
=======

* **Fix:** Fixed a bug in ``stalker.models.auth.LocalSession`` where stalker
  was complaining about "copy_reg" module, it seems that it is related to
  `this bug`_.

  .. _this bug: http://www.archivum.info/python-bugs-list@python.org/2007-04/msg00222.html

0.2.3.4
=======

* **Update:** Fixed a little bug in Link.extension property setter.
* **New:** Moved the stalker.models.env.EnvironmentBase class to
  "Anima Tools" python module.
* **Fix:** Fixed a bug in stalker.models.task.Task._responsible_getter() where
  it was always returning the greatest parents responsible as the responsible
  for the child task when the responsible is set to None for the child.
* **New:** Added ``stalker.models.version.Version.naming_parents`` which
  returns a list of parents starting from the closest parent Asset, Shot or
  Sequence.
* **New:** ``stalker.models.version.Version.nice_name`` now generates a name
  starting from the closest Asset, Shot or Sequence parent.

0.2.3.3
=======

* **New:** Ticket action methods (resolve, accept, reassign, reopen) now
  return the created TicketLog instance.

0.2.3.2
=======

* **Update:** Added tests for negative or zero fps value in Project class.
* **Fix:** Minor fix to ``schedule_timing`` argument in Task class, where IDEs
  where assuming that the value passed to the ``schedule_timing`` should be
  integer where as it accepts floats also.
* **Update:** Removed ``bg_color`` and ``fg_color`` attributes (and columns)
  from Status class. Use SimpleEntity.html_class and SimpleEntity.html_style
  attributes instead.
* **New:** Added ``Project.open_tickets`` property.

0.2.3.1
=======

* **Fix:** Fixed an inconvenience in SimpleEntity.__init__() when a
  date_created argument with a value is later than datetime.datetime.now() is
  supplied and the date_updated argument is skipped or given as None, then the
  date_updated attribute value was generated from datetime.datetime.now() this
  was causing an unnecessary ValueError. This is fixed by directly copying the
  date_created value to date_updated value when it is skipped or None.

0.2.3
=====

* **New:** SimpleEntity now have two new attributes called ``html_style`` and
  ``html_class`` which can be used in storing cosmetic html values.

0.2.2.3
=======

* **Update:** Note.content attribute is now a synonym of the Note.description
  attribute.

0.2.2.2
=======

* **Update:** Studio.schedule() now returns information about how much did it
  take to schedule the tasks.
* **Update:** Studio.to_tjp() now returns information about how much did it
  take to complete the conversion.

0.2.2.1
=======

* **Fix:** Task.percent_complete() now calculates the percent complete
  correctly.

0.2.2
=====

* **Update:** Added cascade attributes to all necessary relations for all the
  classes.
* **Update:** The Version class is not mixed with the StatusMixin anymore. So
  the versions are not going to be statusable anymore. Also created alembic
  revision (a6598cde6b) for that update.

0.2.1.2
=======

* **Update:** TaskJugglerScheduler and the Studio classes are now returning the
  stderr message out of their ``schedule()`` methods.

0.2.1.1
=======

* **Fix:** Disabled some deep debug messages on
  TaskJugglerScheduler._parse_csv_file().
* **Fix:** Fixed a flush issue related to the Task.parent attribute which is
  lazily loaded in Task._schedule_seconds_setter().

0.2.1
=====

* **Fix:** As usual distutil thinks ``0.2.0`` is a lower version number than
  ``0.2.0.rc5`` (I should have read the documentation again and used
  ``0.2.0.c5`` instead of ``0.2.0.rc5``) so this is a dummy update to just to
  fix the version number.

0.2.0
=====

* **Update:** Vacation tjp template now includes the time values of the start
  and end dates of the Vacation instance.

0.2.0.rc5
=========

* **Update:** For a container task, **Task.total_logged_seconds** and
  **Task.schedule_seconds** attributes are now using the info of the child
  tasks. Also these attributes are cached to database, so instead of querying
  the child tasks all the time, the calculated data is cached and whenever a
  TimeLog is created or updated for a child task (which changes the
  **total_logged_seconds** for the child task) or the **schedule_timing** or
  **schedule_unit** attributes are updated, the cached values are updated on
  the parents. Allowing Stalker to display percent_complete info of a container
  task without loading any of its children.
* **New:** Added **Task.percent_complete** attribute, which calculates the
  percent of completeness of the task based on the
  **Task.total_logged_seconds** and **Task.schedule_seconds** attributes.
* **Fix:** Added TimeLog.__eq__() operator to more robustly check if the time
  logs are overlapping.
* **New:** Added **Project.percent_complete**,
  **Percent.total_logged_seconds** and **Project.schedule_seconds** attributes.
* **Update:** **ScheduleMixin._validate_dates()** does not set the date values
  anymore, it just return the calculated and validated start, end and duration
  values.
* **Update:** **Vacation** now can be created without a user instance, effectively
  making the Vacation a Studio wide vacation, which applies to all users.
* **Update:** **Vacation.__strictly_typed__** is updated to **False**, so there
  is no need to create a **Type** instance to be able to create a Vacation.
* **New:** **Studio.vacations** property now returns the **Vacation** instances
  which has now *user*.
* **Update:** **Task.start** and **Task.end** values are no more read from
  children Tasks for a container task over and over again but calculated
  whenever the start and end values of a child task are changed or a new child
  is appended or removed.
* **Update:** **SimpleEntity.description** validation routine doesn't convert
  the input to string anymore, but checks the given description value against
  being a string or unicode instance.
* **New:** Added **Ticket.summary** field.
* **Fix:** Fixed **Link.extension**, it is now accepting unicode.

0.2.0.rc4
=========

* **New:** Added a new attribute to **Version** class called
  **latest_version** which holds the latest version in the version queue.
* **New:** To optimize the database connection times, *stalker.db.setup()* will
  not try to initialize the database every time it is called anymore. This
  leads a ~4x speed up in database connection setup. To initialize a newly
  created database please use::

    # for a newly created database
    from stalker import db
    db.setup() # connects to database
    db.init()  # fills some default values to be used with Stalker

    # for any subsequent access just use (don't need to call db.init())
    db.setup()

* **Update:** Removed all **__init_on_load()** methods from all of the classes.
  It was causing SQLAlchemy to eagerly load relations, thus slowing down
  queries in certain cases (especially in Task.parent -> Task.children
  relation).
* **Fix:** Fixed Vacation class tj3 format.
* **Fix:** **Studio.now** attribute was not properly working when the Studio
  instance has been restored from database.

0.2.0.rc3
=========

* **New:** Added a new attribute to **Task** class called **responsible**.
* **Update:** Removed **Sequence.lead_id** use **Task.reponsible** instead.
* **Update:** Updated documentation to include documentation about
  Configuring Stalker with ``config.py``.
* **Update:** The ``duration`` argument in Task class is removed. It is somehow
  against the idea of having ``schedule_model`` and ``schedule_timing``
  arguments (schedule_model='duration' is kind of the same).
* **Update:** Updated task documentation.

0.2.0.rc2
=========

* **New:** Added **Version.created_with** attribute to track the environment or
  host program name that a particular Version instance is created with.

0.2.0.rc1
=========

* **Update:** Moved the Pyramid part of the system to another package called
  **stalker_pyramid**.
* **Fix:** Fixed ``setup.py`` where importing ``stalker`` to get the
  ``__version__`` variable causing problems.

0.2.0.b9
========

* **New:** Added **Version.latest_published_version** and
  **Version.is_latest_published_version()**.
* **Fix:** Fixed **Version.__eq__()**, now Stalker correctly distinguishes
  different Version instances.
* **New:** Added **Repository.to_linux_path()**,
  **Repository.to_windows_path()**, **Repository.to_osx_path()** and
  **Repository.to_native_path()** to the **Repository** class.
* **New:** Added **Repository.is_in_repo(path)** which checks if the given
  path is in this repo.

0.2.0.b8
========

* **Update:** Renamed **Version.version_of** attribute to **Version.task**.
* **Fix:** Fixed **Version.version_number** where it was not possible to have
  a version number bigger than 2.
* **Fix:** In **db.setup()** Ticket statuses are only created if there aren't
  any.
* **Fix:** Added **Vacation** class to the registered class list in
  stalker.db.

0.2.0.b7
========

* **Update:** **Task.schedule_constraint** is now reflected to the tjp file
  correctly.
* **Fix:** **check_circular_dependency()** now checks if the **entity** and
  the **other_entity** are the same.
* **Fix:** **Task.to_tjp()** now correctly add the dependent tasks of a
  container task.
* **Fix:** **Task.__eq__()** now correctly considers the parent, depends,
  resources, start and end dates.
* **Update:** **Task.priority** is now reflected in tjp file if it is
  different than the default value (500).
* **New::** Added a new class called **Vacation** to hold user vacations.
* **Update:** Removed dependencies to ``pyramid.security.Allow`` and
  ``pyramid.security.Deny`` in couple of packages.
* **Update:** Changed the way the ``stalker.defaults`` is created.
* **Fix:** **EnvironmentBase.get_version_from_full_path()**,
  **EnvironmentBase.get_versions_from_path()**,
  **EnvironmentBase.trim_repo_path()**, **EnvironmentBase.find_repo** methods
  are now working properly.
* **Update:** Added **Version.absolute_full_path** property which renders the
  absolute full path which also includes the repository path.
* **Update:** Added **Version.absolute_path** property which renders the
  absolute path which also includes the repository path.

0.2.0.b6
========

* **Fix:** Fixed **LocalSession._write_data()**, previously it was not
  creating the local session folder.
* **New:** Added a new method called **LocalSession.delete()** to remove the
  local session file.
* **Update:** **Link.full_path** can now be set to an empty string. This is
  updated in this way for **Version** class.
* **Update:** Updated the formatting of **SimpleEntity.nice_name**, it is now
  possible to have uppercase letters and camel case format will be preserved.
* **Update**: **Version.take_name** formatting is enhanced.
* **New**: **Task** class is now mixed in with **ReferenceMixin** making it
  unnecessary to have **Asset**, **Shot** and **Sequence** classes all mixed
  in individually. Thus removed the **ReferenceMixin** from **Asset**,
  **Shot** and **Sequence** classes.
* **Update**: Added **Task.schedule_model** validation and its tests.
* **New**: Added **ScheduleMixin.total_seconds** and
  **ScheduleMixin.computed_total_seconds**.

0.2.0.b5
========

* **New:** **Version** class now has two new attributes called ``parent`` and
  ``children`` which will be used in tracking of the history of Version
  instances and track which Versions are derived from which Version.
* **New:** **Versions** instances are now derived from **Link** class and not
  **Entity**.
* **Update:** Added new revisions to **alembic** to reflect the change in
  **Versions** table.
* **Update:** **Links.path** is renamed to **Links.full_path** and added
  three new attributes called **path**, **filename** and **extension**.
* **Update:** Added new revisions to alembic to reflect the change in
  **Links** table.
* **New:** Added a new class called **LocalSession** to store session data in
  users local filesystem. It is going to be replaced with some other system
  like **Beaker**.
* **Fix:** Database part of Stalker can now be imported without depending to
  **Pyramid**.
* **Fix:** Fixed documentation errors that **Sphinx** complained about.

0.2.0.b4
========

* No changes in SOM.

0.2.0.b3
========

* **Update:** FilenameTemplate's are not ``strictly typed`` anymore.
* **Update:** Removed the FilenameTemplate type initialization, FilenameTemplates
  do not depend on Types anymore.
* **Update:** Added back the ``plural_class_name`` (previously ``plural_name``)
  property to the ORMClass class, so all the classes in SOM now have this new
  property. 
* **Update:** Added ``accepts_references`` attribute to the EntityType class.
* **New:** The Link class has a new attribute called ``original_filename`` to
  store the original file names of link files.
* **New:** Added **alembic** to the project requirements.
* **New:** Added alembic migrations which adds the ``accepts_references`` column
  to ``EntityTypes`` table and ``original_name`` to the ``Links`` table.

0.2.0.b2
========

* Stalker is now compatible with Python 2.6.
* Task:

  * **Update:** Tasks now have a new attribute called ``watchers`` which holds a
    list of User instances watching the particular Task.
  * **Update:** Users now have a new attribute called ``watching`` which is a
    list of Task instances that this user is watching.

* TimeLog:

  * **Update:** TimeLog instances will expand Task.schedule_timing value
    automatically if the total amount of logged time is more than the
    schedule_timing value.
  * **Update:** TimeLogs are now considered while scheduling the task.
  * **Fix:** TimeLogs raises OverBookedError when appending the same TimeLog
    instance to the same resource.

* Auth:

  * **Fix:** The default ACLs for determining the permissions are now working
    properly.

0.2.0.b1
========

* WorkingHours.is_working_hour() is working now.
* WorkingHours class is moved from stalker.models.project to
  stalker.models.studio module.
* ``daily_working_hours`` attribute is moved from
  stalker.models.project.Project to stalker.models.studio.Studio class.
* Repository path variables now ends with a forward slash even if it is not
  given.
* Updated Project classes validation messages to correlate with Stalker
  standard.
* Implementation of the Studio class is finished. The scheduling works like a
  charm.
* It is now possible to use any characters in SimpleEntity.name and the derived
  classes.
* Booking class is renamed to TimeLog.

0.2.0.a10
=========

* Added new attribute to WorkingHours class called ``weekly_working_hours``,
  which calculates the weekly working hours based on the working hours defined
  in the instance.
* Task class now has a new attribute called ``schedule_timing`` which is
  replacing the ``effort``, ``length`` and ``duration`` attributes. Together
  with the ``schedule_model`` attribute it will be used in scheduling the Task.
* Updated the config system to the one used in oyProjectManager (based on
  Sphinx config system). Now to reach the defaults::

    # instead of doing the following
    from stalker.conf import defaults # not valid anymore
    
    # use this
    from stalker import defaults
  
  If the above idiom is used, the old ``defaults`` module behaviour is
  retained, so no code change is required other than the new lower case config
  variable names.

0.2.0.a9
========

* A new property called ``to_tjp`` added to the SimpleEntity class which needs
  to be implemented in the child and is going to be used in TaskJuggler
  integration.
* A new attribute called ``is_scheduled`` added to Task class and it is going
  to be used in Gantt charts. Where it will lock the class and will not try
  to snap it to anywhere if it is scheduled.
* Changed the ``resolution`` attribute name to ``timing_resolution`` to comply
  with TaskJuggler.
* ScheduleMixin:

  * Updated ScheduleMixin class documentation.
  * There are two new read-only attributes called ``computed_start`` and
    ``computed_end``. These attributes will be used in storing of the values
    calculated by TaskJuggler, and will be used in Gantt Charts if available.
  * Added ``computed_duration``.

* Task:

  * Arranged the TaskJuggler workflow.
  * The task will use the effort > length > duration attributes in `to_tjp`
    property.

* Changed the license of Stalker from BSD-2 to LGPL 2.1. Any version previous
  to 0.2.0.a9 will be still BSD-2 and any version from and including 0.2.0.a9
  will be distributed under LGPL 2.1 license.
* Added new types of classes called Schedulers which are going to be used in
  scheduling the tasks.
* Added TaskJugglerScheduler, it uses the given project and schedules its
  tasks.

0.2.0.a8
========

* TagSelect now can be filled by setting its ``value`` attribute (Ex:
  TagSelect.set('value', data))
* Added a new method called ``is_root`` to Task class. It is true for tasks
  where there are no parents.
* Added a new attribute called ``users`` to the Department class which is a
  synonym for the ``members`` attribute.
* Task:

  * Task class is now preventing one of the dependents to be set as the parent
    of a task.
  * Task class is now preventing one of the parents to be set as the one of the
    dependents of a task.
  * Fixed ``autoflush`` bugs in Task class.

* Fixed `admin` users department initialization.
* Added ``thumbnail`` attribute to the SimpleEntity class which is a reference
  to a Link instance, showing the path of the thumbnail.
* Fixed Circular Dependency bug in Task class, where a parent of a newly
  created task is depending to another task which is set as the dependee for
  this newly created task (T1 -> T3 -> T2 -> T1 (parent relation) -> T3 -> T2
  etc.).

0.2.0.a7
========

* Changed these default setting value names to corresponding new names:

  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_DURATION`` -> ``TASK_DURATION``
  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_PRIORITY`` -> ``TASK_PRIORITY``
  * ``DEFAULT_VERSION_TAKE_NAME`` -> ``VERSION_TAKE_NAME``
  * ``DEFAULT_TICKET_LABEL`` -> ``TICKET_LABEL``
  * ``DEFAULT_ACTIONS`` -> ``ACTIONS``
  * ``DEFAULT_BG_COLOR`` -> ``BG_COLOR``
  * ``DEFAULT_FG_COLOR`` -> ``FG_COLOR``

* stalker.conf.defaults:

  * Added default settings for project working hours (``WORKING_HOURS``,
    ``DAY_ORDER``, ``DAILY_WORKING_HOURS``)
  * Added a new variable for setting the task time resolution called
    ``TIME_RESOLUTION``.

* stalker.models.project.Project:

  * Removed Project.project_tasks attribute, use Project.tasks directly to get
    all the Tasks in that project. For root task you can do a quick query::

      Task.query.filter(Task.project==proj_id).filter(Task.parent==None).all()
    
    This will also return the Assets, Sequences and Shots in that project,
    which are also Tasks.
  * Users are now assigned to Projects by appending them to the Project.users
    list. This is done in this way to allow a reduced list of resources to be
    shown in the Task creation dialogs.
  * Added a new helper class for Project working hour management, called
    WorkingHours.
  * Added a new attribute to Project class called ``working_hours`` which holds
    stalker.models.project.WorkingHours instances to manage the Project working
    hours. It will directly be passed to TaskJuggler.

* stalker.models.task.Task:

  * Removed the Task.task_of attribute, use Task.parent to get the owner of
    this Task.
  * Task now has two new attributes called Task.parent and Task.children which
    allow more complex Task-to-Task relation.
  * Secondary table name for holding Task to Task dependency relation is
    renamed from ``Task_Tasks`` to ``Task_Dependencies``.
  * check_circular_dependency function is now accepting a third argument which
    is the name of the attribute to be investigated for circular relationship.
    It is done in that way to be able to use the same function in searching for
    circular relations both in parent/child and depender/dependee relations.

* ScheduleMixin:

  * Added a new attribute to ScheduleMixin for time resolution adjustment.
    Default value is 1 hour and can be set with
    stalker.conf.defaults.TIME_RESOLUTION. Any finer time than the resolution
    is rounded to the closest multiply of the resolution. It is possible to set
    it from microseconds to years. Although 1 hour is a very reasonable
    resolution which is also the default resolution for TaskJuggler.
  * ScheduleMixin now uses datetime.datetime for the start and end attributes.
  * Renamed the ``start_date`` attribute to ``start``.
  * Renamed the ``end_date`` attribute to ``end``

* Removed the TaskableEntity.
* Asset, Sequence and Shot classes are now derived from Task class allowing
  more complex Task relation combined with the new parent/child relation of
  Tasks. Use Asset.children or Asset.tasks to reach the child tasks of that
  asset (same with Sequence and Shot classes).
* stalker.models.shot.Shot:

  * Removed the sequence and introduced sequences attribute in Shot class. Now
    one shot can be in more than one Sequence. Allowing more complex
    Shot/Sequence relations..
  * Shots can now be created without a Sequence instance. The sequence
    attribute is just used to group the Shots.
  * Shots now have a new attribute called ``scenes``, holding Scene instances.
    It is created to group same shots occurring in the same scenes.

* In tests all the Warnings are now properly handled as Warnings.
* stalker.models.ticket.Ticket:

  * Ticket instances are now tied to Projects and it is now possible to create
    Tickets without supplying a Version. They are free now.
  * It is now possible to link any SimpleEntity to a Ticket.
  * The Ticket Workflow is now fully customizable. Use
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_WORKFLOW dictionary to define the workflow and
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_STATUS_ORDER for the order of the ticket
    statuses.

* Added a new class called ``Scene`` to manage Shots with another property.
* Removed the ``output_path`` attribute in FilenameTemplate class.
* Grouped the templates for each entity under a directory with the entity name.

0.2.0.a6
========

* Users now can have more than one Department.
* User instances now have two new properties for getting the user tickets
  (User.tickets) and the open tickets (User.open_tickets).
* New shortcut Task.project returns the Task.task_of.project value.
* Shot and Asset creation dialogs now automatically updated with the given
  Project instance info.
* User overview page is now reflection the new design.

0.2.0.a5
========

* The ``code`` attribute of the SimpleEntity is now introduced as a separate
  mixin. To let it be used by the classes it is really needed.
* The ``query`` method is now converted to a property so it is now possible to
  use it like a property as in the SQLAlchemy.orm.Session as shown below::

    from stalker import Project
    Project.query.all() # instead of Project.query().all()

* ScheduleMixin.due_date is renamed to ScheduleMixin.end_date.
* Added a new class attribute to SimpleEntity called ``__auto_name__`` which
  controls the naming of the instances and instances derived from SimpleEntity.
  If ``__auto_name__`` is set to True the ``name`` attribute of the instance
  will be automatically generated and it will have the following format::

    {{ClassName}}_{{UUID4}}
    
  Here are a couple of naming examples::

    Ticket_74bb46b0-29de-4f3e-b4e6-8bcf6aed352d
    Version_2fa5749e-8cdb-4887-aef2-6d8cec6a4faa

* Fixed an autoflush issue with SQLAlchemy in StatusList class. Now the status
  column is again not nullable in StatusMixin.

0.2.0.a4
========

* Added a new class called EntityType to hold all the available class names and
  capabilities.
* Version class now has a new attribute called ``inputs`` to hold the inputs of
  the current Version instance. It is a list of Link instances.
* FilenameTemplate classes ``path`` and ``filename`` attributes are no more
  converted to string, so given a non string value will raise TypeError.
* Structure.custom_template now only accepts strings and None, setting it to
  anything else will raise a TypeError.
* Two Type's for FilenameTemplate's are created by default when initializing
  the database, first is called "Version" and it is used to define
  FilenameTemplates which are used for placing Version source files. The second
  one is called "Reference" and it is used when injecting references to a given
  class. Along with the FilenameTemplate.target_entity_type this will allow one
  to create two different FilenameTemplates for one class::

    # first get the Types
    vers_type = Type.query()\
                .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
                .filter_by(type="Version")\
                .first()
    
    ref_type = Type.query()\
               .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
               .filter_by(type="Reference")\
               .first()
    
    # lets create a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Version files.
    f_ver = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=vers_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/{{task.type.code}}",
        filename="{{asset.code}}_{{version.take_name}}_{{task.type.code}}_v{{'%03d'|version.version_number}}{{link.extension}}"
        output_path="{{version.path}}/Outputs/{{version.take_name}}"
    )
    
    # and now define a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Reference files.
    # no need to have an output_path here...
    f_ref = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=ref_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/References",
        filename="{{link.type.code}}/{{link.id}}{{link.extension}}"
    )

* stalker.db.register() now accepts only real classes instead of class names.
  This way it can store more information about classes.
* Status.bg_color and Status.fg_color attributes are now simple integers. And
  the Color class is removed.
* StatusMixin.status is now a ForeignKey to a the Statuses table, thus it is a
  real Status instance instead of an integer showing the index of the Status in
  the related StatusList. This way the Status of the object will not change if
  the content of the StatusList is changed.
* Added new attribute Project.project_tasks which holds all the direct or
  indirect Tasks created for that project.
* User.login_name is renamed to User.login.
* Removed the ``first_name``, ``last_name`` and ``initials`` attributes from
  User class. Now the ``name`` and ``code`` attributes are going to be used,
  thus the ``name`` attribute is no more the equivalent of ``login`` and the
  ``code`` attribute is doing what was ``initials`` doing previously.

0.2.0.a3
========

* Status class now has two new attributes ``bg_color`` and ``fg_color`` to hold
  the UI colors of the Status instance. The colors are Color instances.

0.2.0.a2
========

* SimpleEntity now has an attribute called ``generic_data`` which can hold any
  kind of ``SOM`` object inside and it is a list.
* Changed the formatting rules for the ``name`` in SimpleEntity class, now it
  can start with a number, and it is not allowed to have multiple whitespace
  characters following each other.
* The ``source`` attribute in Version is renamed to ``source_file``.
* The ``version`` attribute in Version is renamed to ``version_number``.
* The ``take`` attribute in Version is renamed to ``take_name``.
* The ``version_number`` in Version is now generated automatically if it is
  skipped or given as None or it is too low where there is already a version
  number for the same Version series (means attached to the same Task and has
  the same ``take_name``.
* Moved the User class to ``stalker.models.auth module``.
* Removed the ``stalker.ext.auth`` module because it is not necessary anymore.
  Thus the User now handles all the password conversions by itself.
* ``PermissionGroup`` is renamed back to Group
  again to match with the general naming of the authorization concept.
* Created two new classes for the Authorization system, first one is called
  Permission and the second one is a Mixin which is called ACLMixin which adds
  ACLs to the mixed in class. For now, only the User and Group classes are
  mixed with this mixin by default.
* The declarative Base class of SQLAlchemy is now created by binding it to a
  ORMClass (a random name) which lets all the derived class to have a method
  called ``query`` which will bypass the need of calling
  ``DBSession.query(class_)`` but instead just call ``class_.query()``::

    from stalker.models.auth import User
    user_1 = User.query().filter_by(name='a user name').first()


0.2.0.a1
========

* Changed the ``db.setup`` arguments. It is now accepting a dictionary instead
  of just a string to comply with the SQLAlchemy scaffold and this dictionary
  should contain keys for the SQLAlchemy engine setup. There is another utility
  that comes with Pyramid to setup the database under the `scripts` folder, it
  is also working without any problem with stalker.db.
* The ``session`` variable is renamed to ``DBSession`` and is now a scopped
  session, so there is no need to use ``DBSession.commit`` it will be handled
  by the system it self.
* Even though the ``DBSession`` is using the Zope Transaction Manager extension
  normally, in the database tests no extension is used because the transaction
  manager was swallowing all errors and it was a little weird to try to catch
  this errors out of the ``with`` block.
* Refactored the code, all the models are now in separate python files, but can
  be directly imported from the main stalker module as shown::

    from stalker import User, Department, Task
  
  By using this kind of organization, both development and usage will be eased
  out.
  
* ``task_of`` now only accepts TaskableEntity instances.
* Updated the examples. It is now showing how to extend SOM correctly. 
* Updated the references to the SOM classes in docstrings and rst files.
* Removed the ``Review`` class. And introduced the much handier Ticket class.
  Now reviewing a data is the process of creating Ticket's to that data.
* The database is now initialized with a StatusList and a couple of Statuses
  appropriate for Ticket instances.
* The database is now initialized with two Type instances ('Enhancement' and
  'Defect') suitable for Ticket instances.
* StatusMixin now stores the status attribute as an Integer showing the index
  of the Status in the ``status_list`` attribute but when asked for the value
  of ``StatusMixin.status`` attribute it will return a proper Status instance
  and the attribute can be set with an integer or with a proper Status
  instance.
