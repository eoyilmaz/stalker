Stalker Changes
===============

v0.1.1.a7
---------

 * Updated the :ref:`roadmap_toplevel` to reflect the current development
   history and cycle

 * Merged all the model classes which were previously in separate files in to
   :mod:`stalker.core.models` module, to make it easy to use (and possibly hard
   to develop)

 * All the references to modules or classes or anything in the source codes are
   now represented by an absolute path in the docs (
   :class:`stalker.core.models.User` instead of
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`)

 * moved the :mod:`stalker.db.auth` to :mod:`stalker.ext.auth`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.User` class now uses the
   :func:`stalker.ext.auth.set_password` and
   :func:`stalker.ext.auth.check_password` utility functions to handle
   passwords. The user passwords are now always hidden, but not strongly
   encrypted.

 * The :func:`stalker.ext.auth.session` renamed to
   :func:`stalker.ext.auth.create_session` to reflect its functionality
   properly. And removed the return value from the function. Now it doesn't
   return any bool value but None. To check if the user is already logged in
   use :const:`stalker.ext.auth.SESSION` dictionary as follows::
   
     from stalker.ext import auth
     
     # initialize the session
     auth.create_session()
     
     # check if there is a user
     if auth.SESSION_KEY in auth.SESSION:
         print "There is a logged in user"
     else:
         print "There is no logged in user"

 * :func:`stalker.ext.auth.authenticate` updated to use
   :func:`stalker.ext.auth.check_password`

 * Fixed the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.last_login` attribute in the
   database mapper, it was set as a *synonym* for it self.

 * Removed the ``tearDown`` methods in :mod:`tests.db.test_db`, there are
   problems with cleaning the mappers and disposing the engine, so instead of
   killing them the db.setup is called over and over again with different in
   memory databases.

 * From now on the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.code` attribute
   doesn't format the given string value too heavily, to allow more individual
   naming conventions to work with Stalker.

 * Updated :ref:`contribute_toplevel`

 * Renamed the :class:`~stalker.core.models.PipelineStep` to
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.TaskType` and changed the idea behind the
   relation between :class:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType` and
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.AssetType` classes
   :attr:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType.pipeline_steps` attribute has been
   renamed to :attr:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType.task_types`

 * Fixed a little error in the mapper of :class:`stalker.core.models.Structure`

 * Re-implemented the :func:`stalker.ext.auth.login` function and updated the
   tests accordingly.

 * All the error classes in :mod:`stalker.core.models` moved to
   :mod:`stalker.core.errors`

 * Added a new error class called :class:`stalker.core.errors.DBError`

 * Fixed a bug in :const:`stalker.db.__mappers__`, it is now possible to add
   new mappers without deleting the previous
   :const:`stalker.conf.defaults.MAPPERS` list.

 * Removed the :class:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType` and derived the
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` and :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset`
   classes from :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity`.

 * Moved the mixin classes from :mod:`stalker.core.models` to
   :mod:`stalker.core.mixins`

 * Introduced the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` which gives the
   ability to connect a list of tasks to the mixed in class. Also added the
   mapper setup for this mixin.

 * :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now accepts string values
   for the ``type_`` argument.

 * Added :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class and test for it.

 * Updated the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` database tests according
   to new rules introduced with the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class.

 * :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now imports the given
   types lazily when the type is given as a string path.

 * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` now needs a
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` instance to be created.

 * It is now possible to assign :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s to
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` and
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`\ s. Also updated the tests for this
   change.

 * Removed the ``shots`` argument from the
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` class initialization. Because there
   is no way to create a :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` without a
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` instance.

 * Added tests for mixin initialization for
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project`,
   :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`, :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`
   and :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` classes.

 * Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` where it was always
   initializing the references with an empty list no matter what is given.

 * Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` where it was always
   initializing the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.start_date` to
   **datetime.date.today** and the
   :attr:`~stalker.core.models.project.due_date` to 10 days later then the
   :attr:`~stalker.core.models.project.start_date` no matter what are given.

 * Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ReferenceMixin` where it was not
   initializing the reference attribute correctly.

 * Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` where the
   :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Asset.project` attribute was not correctly
   getting the given :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` instance.

 * Added the mappers and tables for :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class.

 * Updated database model tests to test all the attributes of the models.

v0.1.1.a6
---------

 * updated/fixed tests for :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList`

 * updated a couple of tests to increase tests coverage

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status` class instances now can be
   compared to string or unicode values

 * A :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status` object in a
   :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` can now be accessed by its
   name as the index in :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` only
   while getting the item.

 * Added :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ScheduleMixin` which introduces date
   variables like, start_date, due_date and duration to the mixed in class.

 * Removed some parts of the :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class
   which are now satisfied by the
   :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ScheduleMixin`

 * Improved the implementation of the :mod:`stalker.db.auth` module

 * removed the ``stalker.db.__setup__`` module which were helping to reference
   the variables in :mod:`stalker.db` module but it is not needed any more

 * It is now possible to initialize a
   :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` object without a
   :class:`stalker.core.models.repository.Repository`,
   :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure` or an
   :class:`stalker.core.models.imageFormat.ImageFormat` or a
   :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

 * Updated the :ref:`tutorial_toplevel`

 * From now on, in a :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity`,
   setting the code attribute to None or empty string will not raise any
   ``ValueError``\ s but will re-initialize the ``code`` value from the
   ``nice_name`` attribute.

 * Implemented :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence` class along with
   its tests

 * added :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence` equality tests

 * improved :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` equality tests

 * Implemented :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase` class along
   with its tests

 * The **index.rst** of the documentation now references the **README** from
   the project root.

 * added the basic implementation of :class:`stalker.core.models.task.Task`
   and :class:`stalker.core.models.shot.Shot` and mapped them very basically
   to be able to test the dependent classes like
   :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase` and
   :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence`

 * Added mappers and tables for
   :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase`

 * Now all the mixin classes have proper :func:`__init__` methods, and in a
   mixed class, the mixin classes' :func:`__init__` method can be called
   directly by giving the current object instance (*self*) like shown below::
     
     class ANewEntity(entity.SimpleEntity, mixin.StatusMixin):
         def __init__(self, **kwargs):
             super(ANewEntity, self).__init__(**kwargs)
             mixin.StatusMixin.__init__(self, **kwargs)
   
   and it can be repeated for any number of mixins in class inheritance path

 * Added the **CHANGELOG** to the documentation, and updated all formating of
   the mentioned references inside the file.

v0.1.1.a5
---------

 * removed the :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity` and its
   tests, with the introduction of
   :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin`, it is not necessary any
   more

 * added camera_lens.py to the examples, which shows how to extend SOM in its
   very basic form, also added tests testing this example

 * changed the database uri for the **DatabaseTester**, it now uses an in
   memory SQLite database instead a file based one.

 * Updated the version numbers in the roadmap

 * Added ``last_login`` attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`
   class tables and mapped it

 * because it was taking too much space in the diffs the VUE file which shows
   the design sketches has been removed from the trunk

 * added the :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` class which is a
   list derivative that accepts only one type of object.

 * these SOM classes listed below uses
   :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` in their list attributes
   requiring specific types of objects to be assigned:

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.Entity`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.department.Department`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`

 * added tests of the :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class

 * completed the first implementation of the
   :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class

 * to be able to use *assertIsInstance* method of
   :class:`mocker.MockerTestCase` all the
   :class:`unittest.TestCase` test classes are converted to
   :class:`mocker.MockerTestCase`

 * changed the design of the **stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup**
   and **stalker.db.mixins.StatusMixin.setup** to organize the mixin
   classes' database setup helper functions, now they are converted to classes
   with a classmethod called :meth:`stalker.db.mixin.ReferenceMixinDB.setup`
   doing all the functionality of the previous setup function and placed them
   under the :mod:`stalker.db.mixin` module.

 * added persistence tests for :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project`

 * fixed secondary table generation for
   :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`, the table is now
   created only if it doesn't exists already, and it is retrieved from
   :attr:`stalker.db.metadata` if it exists

v0.1.1.a4
---------

 * changed the arguments of the
   :func:`stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup` function, to allow
   carrying the data from one to the next mixin (this part still needs a lot of
   attention)

 * removed the unnecessary ``statusedEntity_statuses`` secondary table, because
   one :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity` owns just one
   :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` its a **many2one** relation,
   so no need to have a secondary table

 * introduced the :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin` (will replace
   StatusedEntity soon)

 * Added a new example for the usage of
   :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin`

 * Updated the :func:`stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup` function, now it
   takes three arguments, the *class*, the *table* and the *mapper_options*
   dictionary.

v0.1.1.a3
---------

 * Removed the included *tests* from the egg build

 * Added/fixed equality and inequality operators for classes:

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.department.Department`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` now has a \*\*kwargs in the
   :func:`__init__` so it doesn't give ``TypeError`` for extra keywords

 * added :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.EntityMeta` metaclass which adds
   ``entity_type`` attribute and sets its value to the unicode version of the
   name of the class

 * the :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` uses the
   :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.EntityMeta` metaclass to automatically
   add all the ``entity_type`` attribute to all the derived classes

 * all the mappers now uses the ``ClassName.entity_type`` class attribute as
   the polymorphic discriminator (polymorphic identity)

 * instead of *LBYL* moving toward *EAFP* idiom for all the models in the
   :mod:`stalker.core`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` now supports indexing

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` now has an
   ``target_entity_type`` attribute which accepts strings with the class name
   and shows the compatible class of this
   :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`

 * :meth:`stakler.core.models.status.StatusList.__eq__` now checks for the
   ``target_entity_type`` also

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusedEntity` now checks for the given
   :attr:`stalker.core.models.StatusList.target_entity_type` for
   compability with the current class

 * All the validation methods in the :mod:`stalker.core.models` now has the
   **validate** word in their name instead of **check**

 * Little fixes:

    * the mapper of :class:`stalker.core.models.types.TypeTemplate` was trying
      to setup a synonym to a parameter with the same name (file_code)

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` classes ``_sequence_lead``
        attribute renamed to ``_sequences_lead``

 * Added persistence tests for
   :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity`

 * Added :func:`stalker.utils.path_to_exec` which converts the given module
   full paths to an executable python code which imports the given python
   object to the current namespace

 * Added ``entity_types`` table to hold the possible entity types in Stalker.
   The content of the table comes from the
   :const:`stalker.conf.defaults.CORE_MODEL_CLASSES` list. And possibly going
   to be extended by the users.

 * Added :func:`stalker.db.__setup__.__fill_entity_types_table__` which fills
   the ``entity_types`` table with default values.

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class now has ``initials`` attribute,
   which is automatically calculated from the first and last name if there is
   no one given.

 * Atarted developing the :class:`stalker.core.models.message.Message` class

 * Added the :mod:`stalker.core.models.mixin` module which holds the common
   mixins

 * Added the :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin` class which
   gives reference abilities to mixed in classes

 * Added the database part of the
   :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`. Now it is possible to
   create a new type of entity and mix it with ReferenceMixin and also persist
   it in the database. But it needs a lot of effort before to have something
   usable.

 * Added **examples** module, which holds usage examples and recipes

 * Added an example about how to create a new mixed in entity type for SOM.

v0.1.1.a2
---------


 * Updated the Tutorial

 * Added *code* attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity`

 * Updated the :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class for the new *code*
   attribute, and also updated the tests to add tests for *code* attribute
   (simply copied the test code from ``SimpleEntityTester``, bad code
   repetition, need to change it later, by may be inheriting the test case from
   the other one)

 * Updated the database tables and mappers for the new *code* attribute

 * Removed the clashing *code* attribute from
   :class:`stalker.core.models.pipelineStep.PipelineStep` class and the tables
   and mappers.

 * Added :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note` class

 * Added ``notes`` table and a mapper for
   :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note` class

 * Added *note* attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.Entity` class

 * Fixed ``EntityTester`` in tests

 * Added ``__repr__`` to entity classes

 * Added tests for persistence of :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note`` class

 * Added equality (__eq__) and inequality (__ne__) operators for classes:

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.tag.Tag`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.imageFormat.ImageFormat`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.repository.Repository`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.pipelineStep.PipelineStep`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.LinkType`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.TypeEntity`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.Status` classes' short_name attribute has been
   removed, from now on the ``code`` attribute will be used, also updated the
   database tables and mappers

 * The :attr:`stalker.core.models.user.User.login_name` is now superior to the
   :attr:`stalker.core.models.user.User.name` attribute, giving both of them as
   arguments will lead the ``login_name`` to be used as both the ``login_name``
   and the ``name``

v0.1.1.a1
---------

 * Fixed a couple of documentation errors like:

    * :ref:`inheritance_diagram_toplevel` had references to modules

    * A couple of docstring documentation errors in
      :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`,
      :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` and
      :class:`stalker.core.models.types.TypeTemplate` classes

 * Updated :ref:`installation_toplevel`

 * Added :ref:`tutorial_toplevel` page to the documentation

 * All the classes, functions from **SQLAlchemy** are now imported to the
   ``sqlalchemy`` namespace, this will let the **Sphinx** to correctly include
   classes, functions from **Stalker** only

 * Removed the ``db.meta module``, now all the functionalities supplied by
   ``stalker.db.meta`` are supplied by ``db`` itself (``db.meta.session`` -->
   ``db.session`` etc.)

 * Added ``query`` variable to :mod:`stalker.db` module so instead of
   ``db.session.query`` now ``db.query`` can be used

 * Updated :func:`stalker.db.auth.login_required` decorator function, it now
   accepts a ``view`` function

 * Added :func:`stalker.db.auth.permission_required` decorator function

 * ``name`` attribute of :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` is
   not any more forced to start with an upper case letter

 * From now on ``login_name`` is now a *synonym* for ``name`` in
   :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class and just the ``name`` attribute
   is going to be stored in the database

 * To make things simple all the properties with name **type_** is now using
   the name **type** even though it is a Python keyword, Python is clever
   enough to understand what is meant

v0.1.1.a0
---------

 * Changed the versioning scheme a little bit to follow the setuptools guide

v0.1.0.20110111.1
-----------------

   :class:`satlker.coer.models.status.StatusList` object for the ``__eq__`` and
   ``__ne__`` tests

 * Updated tables and mappers for
   :class:`stalker.core.models.typeEntity.TypeTemplate`

 * Updated mappers for :class:`stalker.core.models.typeEntity.AssetType`

 * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.TypeEntity` class is moved to
   ``entity.py``, right beside the other entity classes

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.TypeEntity`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.TypeTemplate`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.LinkType`

    * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

 * Updated ``simpleEntities`` table, now the ``name`` by itself is not a
   *unique constraint*, but added an explicit ``UniqueConstraint`` on ``name``
   and ``entity_type`` columns to allow entities with different types to have
   the same name, also added test for that.

 * Fixed all the errors in ``test_db.py``, there are only failures left.

 * Added tests for :class:`stalker.core.models.link.Link`, all the test are
   green for :class:`stalker.core.models.link.Link` except the persistence
   tests.

v0.1.0.20110108.1
-----------------

 * ``Template`` class is renamed to ``TypeTemplate`` and moved inside
   ``stalker.core.models.typeEntity`` to prevent the name clashing with
   **Jinja2** Template class

-----------------

 * re-introduced the link.Link, which has a general meaning than
   reference.Reference (I bet it will be reference again tomorrow)

 * stalker.models moved to stalker.core.models

 * renamed tests/z_db to tests/db, because the sqlalchemy/mocker problem is
   solved by moving the models to core/models

v0.1.0.20110105
---------------

 * improved the stalker.models.template.Template class documentation, and added
   an example showing the usage of it.

v0.1.0.20110104
---------------

 * removed the link.Link and introduced reference.Reference and
   typeEntity.ReferenceType classes, which I think are more organized then the
   previous design.

 * reorganized the AssetType and ReferenceType objects by introducing the new
   TypeEntity class and deriving the AssetType and ReferenceType from this
   class

 * added ProjectType class to hold different project types (like Commercial,
   Film, Still etc., it is different than having a Commercial Structure object)

 * removed AssetTemplate and ReferenceTemplate concepts and generalized the
   Template class by adding a `type` parameter to it, which accepts TypeEntity
   and classes derived from TypeEntity.

v0.1.0.20110103.2
-----------------

 * added login_required decorator to the stalker.db.auth module, but the
   implementation is not done yet

   setting up the database without importing any new module

 * updated the example in the docstring of the template.AssetTemplate

v0.1.0.20101229.3
-----------------

 * generalized the Template class. Now every Entity can be assigned to a
   template, it is not limited with Assets or References.

 * created the block of database tests

 * added stalker.db.meta.__mappers__ list to hold the mappers and use it to
   check if anything is already mapped

 * added tests for db initialization

 * removed the whole stalker.models.unit module from SOM, only TimeUnit was
   usable in some cases, but in fact it is also not important, the only object
   using TimeUnit was the Project class and it can go well without it. Don't
   need to make things more complex than it needs to be.

 * increased the version number to 0.1.0 to follow the stalker roadmap

v0.0.1.20101227
---------------

 * the test_db is converted to a proper unittest which is testing all the
   models one by one

 * test/db renamed to test/z_db to let nose run it latest to solve the problem
   about mocker and sqlalchemy fighting each other.

 * Mapping syntax is changed a little bit, now to do the mapping, the
   <mapper>.setup() function needs to be called to be able to do the mapping
   any time

 * started adding tests for every class in SOM

v0.0.1.20101226
---------------

 * in user.User the last_name attribute could be an empty string

 * removed SimpleEntity, TaggedEntity and introduced StatusedEntity to make the
   inheritance clear and let users to find somebody to blame by moving all the
   audit information to the the SimpleEntity class in which everything is
   inherited from. Now even a Tag has audit information.

v0.0.1.20101225
