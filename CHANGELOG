Stalker Changes
===============

v0.1.1.a5:
 * removed the StatusedEntity and its tests, with the introduction of
   StatusMixin, it is not necessary any more
 * added camera_lens.py to the examples, which shows how to extend SOM in its
   very basic form, also added tests testing this example
 * changed the database uri for the DatabaseTester, it now uses an in memory
   SQLite database instead a file based one.
 * Updated the version numbers in the roadmap
 * Added last_login attribute to User class tables and mapped it
 * because it was taking too much space in the diffs the VUE file which shows
   the design sketches has been removed from the trunk
 * added the ValidatedList class which is a list derivative that accepts only
   one type of object.
 * these SOM classes listed below uses ValidetedList in their list attributes
   requiring spesific types of objects to be assigned:
   * entity.Entity
   * status.StatusList
   * structure.Structure
   * types.AssetType
   * department.Department
   * user.User
   * mixin.ReferenceMixin
 * added tests of the Project class
 * completed the first implementation of the Project class
 * to be able to use assertIsInstance method of mocker.MockerTestCase all the
   unittest.TestCase test classes are converted to mocker.MockerTestCase
 * changed the design of the db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup and
   db.mixins.StatusMixin.setup to orginize the mixin classes' database setup
   helper functions, now they are converted to classes with a
   classmethod called setup doing all the functionality of the previous setup
   function and placed them under the db.mixin module.

v0.1.1.a4:
 * changed the arguments of the stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup
   function, to allow carrying the data from one to the next mixin (this part
   still needs a lot of attention)
 * removed the unnecessary "statusedEntity_statuses" secondary table, because
   one StatusedEntity owns just one StatusList its a many2one relation, so no
   need to have a secondary table
 * introduced the StatusMixin (will replace StatusedEntity soon)
 * added a new example for the usage of StatusMixin
 * updated the ReferenceMixin.setup function, now it takes three arguments, the
   class, table and the mapper_options dictionary

v0.1.1.a3:
 * removed the included *tests* from the egg build
 * added/fixed equality and inequality operators for classes:
  * Department
  * StatusedEntity
 * SimpleEntity now has a **kwargs in the __init__ so it doesn't give TypeError
   for extra keywords
 * added EntityMeta metaclass which adds entity_type attribute and sets its
   value to the unicode version of the name of the class
 * the SimpleEntity uses the EntityMeta metaclass to automatically add all the
   entity_type attribute to all the derived classes
 * all the mappers now uses the ClassName.entity_type class attribute as the
   polymorphic identity
 * instead of LBYL moving toward EAFP idiom for all the models in the
   stalker.core
 * StatusList now supports indexing
 * StatusList now has an target_entity_type attribute which accepts strings
   with the class name and shows the compatible class of this StatusList
 * StatusList.__eq__ now checks for the target_entity_type also
 * StatusedEntity now checks for the given StatusList.target_entity_type for
   compability with the current class
 * all the validation methods in the stalker.core.models now has the "validate"
   word in their name instead of "check"
 * little fixes:
   * the mapper of TypeTemplate was trying to setup a synonym to a parameter
     with the same name (file_code)
   * user.User classes _sequence_lead attribute renamed to _sequences_lead
 * added persistence tests for StatusedEntity
 * added stalker.utils.path_to_exec which converts the given module full paths
   to an executable python code which imports the given python object to the
   current namespace
 * added entity_types table to hold old the possible entity types in Stalker.
   The content of the table comes from the
   stalker.conf.default.CORE_MODEL_CLASSES list. And possibly going to be
   extended by the users.
 * added db.__setup__.__fill_entity_types_table__ which fills the entity_types
   table with default values
 * stalker.core.models.user.User class now has initials attribute, which is
   automatically calculated from the first and last name if there is no one
   given.
 * started developing the message class
 * added the stalker.core.models.mixin module which holds the common mixins
 * added the ReferenceMixin class which gives reference abilities to mixed in
   classes
 * added the database part of the ReferenceMixin. Now it is possible to create
   a new type of entity and mix it with ReferenceMixin and also persist it in
   the database. But it needs a lot of effort before to have something usable.
 * added examples module, which holds usage examples and recipes
 * added an example about how to create a new mixed in entity type for SOM.

v0.1.1.a2:
 * updated the Tutorial
 * added *code* attribute to SimpleEntity
 * updated the User class for the new *code* attribute, and also updated the
   tests to add tests for *code* attribute (simply copied the test code from
   SimpleEntityTester, bad code repetition, need to change it later, by may be
   inheriting the test case from the other one)
 * updated the database tables and mappers for the new *code* attribute
 * removed the clashing *code* attribute from PipelineStep class and the tables
   and mappers
 * added *Note* class
 * added *notes* table and a mapper for *Note* class
 * added *note* attribute to Entity class
 * fixed EntityTester in tests
 * added __repr__ to entity classes
 * added tests for persistence of Note class (tests are green)
 * added equality and inequality operators for classes:
  * User
  * Tag
  * Status
  * StatusList
  * ImageFormat
  * Repository
  * PipelineStep
  * Structure
  * AssetType
  * LinkType
  * TypeEntity
  * ProjectType
 * Status classes' short_name attribute has been removed, from now on the
   *code* attribute will be used, also updated the database tables and mappers
 * The User.login_name is now superior to the *name* attribute, giving both of
   them as arguments will lead the login_name to be used as both the login_name
   and the name

v0.1.1.a1:
 * fixed a couple of documentation errors like:
   * inheritance diagram had references to modules
   * a couple of docstring documentation errors in Structure, User and
     TypeTemplate classes
 * updated the installation instructions
 * added Tutorial page to the documentation
 * all the classes, functions from sqlalchemy are now imported to the
   sqlalchemy namespace, this will let the Sphinx to correctly include classes,
   functions from Stalker only
 * removed the db.meta module, now all the functionalities supplied by db.meta
   are supplied by db (db.meta.session --> db.session etc.)
 * added `query` variable to db module so instead of db.session.query now
   db.query can be used
 * updated login_required decorator function, it now accepts a `view` function
 * added permission_required decorator function
 * name attribute of stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity is not any more
   forced to start with an upper case letter
 * login_name is now a synonym for name in stalker.core.models.user.User
   class and it is not stored in the database any more, just the name attribute
   is stored in the database from now on
 * to make things simpler all the properties with name "type_" is now using the
   name "type" even though it is a Python keyword, Python is clever enough to
   understand what is meant

v0.1.1.a0:
 * changed the versioning scheme a little bit to follow the setuptools guide

v0.1.0.20110111.1:
 * persistence tests for Link is now fixed

v0.1.0.20110110.1:
 * added installation instructions to the documentation
 * updated README file for PyPI
 * added the package to PyPI
 * fixed StatusedEntityTester test suit, now it properly creates mock
   StatusList object for the __eq__ and __ne__ tests
 * updated tables and mappers for stalker.core.models.typeEntity.TypeTemplate
 * updated mappers for stalker.core.models.typeEntity.AssetType
 * TypeEntity class is moved to entity.py, right beside the other entity
   classes
 * typeEntity.py renamed to types.py
 * created tables and mappers for:
   * structure.Structure
   * entity.TypeEntity
   * types.TypeTemplate
   * types.AssetType
   * types.LinkType
   * types.ProjectType
 * updated simpleEntities table, now the name by itself is not a unique
   constraint, but added an explicit UniqueConstraint on name and entity_type
   coloumns to allow entities with different types to have the same name, also
   added test for that
 * fixed all the errors in test_db.py, there are only failures left
 * added tests for stalker.core.models.link.Link, all the test are green for
   Link except the persistence tests

v0.1.0.20110108.1:
 * Template class is renamed to TypeTemplate and moved inside
   stalker.core.models.typeEntity to prevent the name clashing with Jinja2
   Template class

   classes
 * organised the project structure to conform setup tools for PyPI

v0.1.0.20110107.2:
 * updating the db tests
 * stalker.core.models.user.User class is now allowed to have its department
   to be set None

v0.1.0.20110107.1:
 * organised the existent tests

v0.1.0.20110106.2:
 * added nice_name property to the stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity
   class
 * added tests for stalker.core.models.structure.Structure class
 * implemented the stalker.core.models.structure.Structure class
 * added last_login attribute to the stalker.core.models.user.User class and
   added all the tests

v0.1.0.20110106.1:
 * re-introduced the link.Link, which has a general meaning than
   reference.Reference (I bet it will be reference again tomorrow)
 * stalker.models moved to stalker.core.models
 * renamed tests/z_db to tests/db, because the sqlalchemy/mocker problem is
   solved by moving the models to core/models

v0.1.0.20110105:
 * improved the stalker.models.template.Template class documentation, and added
   an example showing the usage of it.

v0.1.0.20110104:
 * removed the link.Link and introduced reference.Reference and
   typeEntity.ReferenceType classes, which I think are more organised then the
   previous design.
 * reorganised the AssetType and ReferenceType objects by introducing the new
   TypeEntity class and deriving the AssetType and ReferenceType from this
   class
 * added ProjectType class to hold different project types (like Commercial,
   Film, Still etc., it is different than having a Commercial Structure object)
 * removed AssetTemplate and ReferenceTemplate concepts and generalised the
   Template class by adding a `type` parameter to it, which accepts TypeEntity
   and classes derived from TypeEntity.

 * added login_required decorator to the stalker.db.auth module, but the
   implementation is not done yet

   setting up the database without importing any new module
 * updated the example in the docstring of the template.AssetTemplate

v0.1.0.20101229.3:
 * generalised the Template class. Now every Entity can be assigned to a
   template, it is not limited with Assets or References.

v0.1.0.20101229.2:
 * entity.SimpleEntity.name now can have white spaces, but not at the beginning
   or end, just in the middle
 * done mapping template.Template class

v0.1.0.20101229.1:

 * created the block of database tests
 * added stalker.db.meta.__mappers__ list to hold the mappers and use it to
   check if anything is already mapped
 * added tests for db initialisation
 * removed the whole stalker.models.unit module from SOM, only TimeUnit was
   usable in some cases, but in fact it is also not important, the only object
   using TimeUnit was the Project class and it can go well without it. Don't
   need to make things more complex than it needs to be.
 * increased the version number to 0.1.0 to follow the stalker roadmap

v0.0.1.20101227:
 * the test_db is converted to a proper unittest which is testing all the
   models one by one
 * test/db renamed to test/z_db to let nose run it latest to solve the problem
   about mocker and sqlalchemy fighting each other.
 * Mapping syntax is changed a little bit, now to do the mapping, the
   <mapper>.setup() function needs to be called to be able to do the mapping
   any time
 * started adding tests for every class in SOM

v0.0.1.20101226:
 * in user.User the last_name attribute could be an empty string
 * removed SimpleEntity, TaggedEntity and introduced StatusedEntity to make the
   inheritance clear and let users to find somebody to blame by moving all the
   audit information to the the SimpleEntity class in which everything is
   inherited from. Now even a Tag has audit information.

v0.0.1.20101225:
 * entity.AuditEntity.created_by can now be None (for now)
 * user.User.last_name can now be None, to let users like admin have no last
   name
 * creating tables for catch the general inheritance of the entity classes
 * entitiy.SimpleEntity.name's first letter is not capitalised any more

 * started playing with the SQLAlchemy side of the system
 
v0.0.1.20101223:

   created, but sets it to the same value with created_by attribute

v0.0.1.20101219:
 * started to implement:
   * a database entry point
   * a customisable object model and database tables
   * an automatic mapper to map the objects and tables together according to
     user settings
   things can change a lot in this phase, I'm just trying to figure out the
   best possible way to do it.
 * added a new entity type called TaggedEntity which derives from SimpleEntity,
   and moved all the tag related attributes of SimpleEntity to TaggedEntity,
   and all the child classes deriving from SimpleEntity now derives from
   TaggedEntity, also moved the tests related with tag in SimpleEntity to
   TaggedEntity.
 * tag.Tag now derives from the SimpleEntity and doesn't add any other
   attribute to its super.
 * updated tests for tag.Tag
 * updated docs for TaggedEntity
 * finished implementing the Department object and its tests
 * removed the notes attribute from the Entity class

v0.0.1.20101209:

 * added the empty classes for:
   * Asset
   * AssetBase
   * Booking
