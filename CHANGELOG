Stalker Changes:
v0.1.0.20101228.1:
 * added repositories table and mapper for the repository.Repository class
 * added imageFormats table and mapper for the imageFormat.ImageFormat class
 * renamed extensions module to ext
 * added roadmap to docs

v0.1.0.20101228:
 * created the block of database tests
 * added stalker.db.meta.__mappers__ list to hold the mappers and use it to
   check if anything is already mapped
 * added tests for db initialization
 * removed the whole stalker.models.unit module from SOM, only TimeUnit was
   usable in some cases, but in fact it is also not important, the only object
   using TimeUnit was the Project class and it can go well without it. Don't
   need to make things more complex than it needs to be.
 * increased the version number to 0.1.0 to follow the stalker roadmap

v0.0.1.20101227:
 * the test_db is converted to a proper unittest which is testing all the
   models one by one
 * test/db renamed to test/z_db to let nose run it latest to solve the problem
   about mocker and sqlalchemy fighting each other.
 * Mapping syntax is changed a little bit, now to do the mapping, the
   <mapper>.setup() function needs to be called to be able to do the mapping
   any time
 * started adding tests for every class in SOM

v0.0.1.20101226:
 * in user.User the last_name attribute could be an empty string
 * removed SimpleEntity, TaggedEntity and introduced StatusedEntity to make the
   inheritance clear and let users to find somebody to blame by moving all the
   audit information to the the SimpleEntity class in which everything is
   inherited from. Now even a Tag has audit information.

v0.0.1.20101225:
 * entity.AuditEntity.created_by can now be None (for now)
 * user.User.last_name can now be None, to let users like admin have no last
   name
 * creating tables for catch the general inheritance of the entity classes
 * entitiy.SimpleEntity.name's first letter is not capitilized anymore
 * department.Department class now accpets Null for lead attribute (for now
   again)

v0.0.1.20101224:
 * started playing with the SQLAlchemy side of the system
 
v0.0.1.20101223:
 * updating the documentation
 * AuditEntity now accepts None for updated_by attribute when it an object is
   created, but sets it to the same value with created_by attribute

v0.0.1.20101219:
 * started to implement:
   * a database entry point
   * a customizable object model and database tables
   * an automatic mapper to map the objects and tables together according to
     user settings
   things can change a lot in this phase, I'm just trying to figure out the
   best possible way to do it.
 * added a new entity type called TaggedEntity which derives from SimpleEntity,
   and moved all the tag related attributes of SimpleEntity to TaggedEntity,
   and all the child classes deriving from SimpleEntity now derives from
   TaggedEntity, also moved the tests related with tag in SimpleEntity to
   TaggedEntity.
 * tag.Tag now derives from the SimpleEntity and doesn't add any other
   attribute to its super.
 * updated tests for tag.Tag
 * updated docs for TaggedEntity
 * finished implementing the Department object and its tests
 * removed the notes attribute from the Entity class
