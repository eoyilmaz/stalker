Stalker Changes
===============

0.2.0.b2
--------

* Stalker is now compatible with Python 2.6.
* WebUI:
  * Replaced DataGrid objects with dgrid.
  * Added navigation bar for assets, shots, sequences

0.2.0.b1
--------

* WorkingHours.is_working_hour() is working now.

* WorkingHours class is moved from stalker.models.project to
  stalker.models.studio module.

* ``daily_working_hours`` attribute is moved from
  stalker.models.project.Project to stalker.models.studio.Studio class.

* Repository path variables now ends with a forward slash even if it is not
  given.

* Updated Project classes validation messages to correlate with Stalker
  standard.

* Implementation of the Studio class is finished. The scheduling works like a
  charm.

* Added dialogCreator.js which helps creating a dialog without having a widget
  (Button or MenuItem) calling it and updated dialogCaller.js to use
  dialogCreator while creating a dialog.

* It is now possible to use any characters in SimpleEntity.name and the derived
  classes.

* jQueryGantt:
  * Fix; t is now possible to correctly move a TaskBar without getting in to
    an infinite loop which was freezing the browser.
  * The timing resolution of jQueryGantt is now 1 hour.
  * Fix; GanttMaster.task_ids were not properly cleaned in GanttMaster.reset(),
    resulting wrong links to be created.
  * Added a new zoom level where it is possible to see the every 1 hour of 1
    day.
  * Colorized the Sunday column in suitable zoom levels. In upcoming releases
    it will use the stalker.models.studio.Studio.working_hours attribute to
    determine if the day/hour is an off day/hour.
  * Disabled editing of date fields.
  * Disabled undo/redo queue for performance test.
  * Fixed vertical overflow in gantt chart.
  * It is now possible to not to align a tasks start to its dependent tasks
    end.  

* The Shot, Asset, Sequence detail pages under the Project Overview now opens
  inside the related tab on the Project Page.

* Booking class is renamed to TimeLog.

0.2.0.a10
---------

* jQueryGantt:
  * jQueryGantt is now using the Task ids coming from Stalker instead of the
    ridiculous rowId.
  * Fixed a lot of issues related with the new data structure, it seems
    everything is working properly right now.
  * Parent Tasks displayed differently than the leaf tasks (on paar with the
    other gantt charts).
  * Gantt chart in User Detail page is now showing the parent tasks of the
    tasks of the user.
  * Now there are two different context menus for container/parent tasks and
    leaf tasks.

* Added new attribute to WorkingHours class called ``weekly_working_hours``,
  which calculates the weekly working hours based on the working hours defined
  in the instance.

* Updated the Create Task Dialog to reflect the TaskJuggler integration.

* Task class now has a new attribute called ``schedule_timing`` which is
  replacing the ``effort``, ``length`` and ``duration`` attributes. Together
  with the ``schedule_model`` attribute it will be used in scheduling the Task.

* Updated the config system to the one used in oyProjectManager (based on
  Sphinx config system). Now to reach the defaults::
    
    # instead of doing the following
    from stalker.conf import defaults # not valid anymore
    
    # use this
    from stalker import defaults
  
  If the above idiom is used, the old ``defaults`` module behaviour is
  retained, so no code change is required other than the new lower case config
  variable names.

0.2.0.a9
--------

* A new property called ``to_tjp`` added to the SimpleEntity class which needs
  to be implemented in the child and is going to be used in TaskJuggler
  integration.

* A new attribute called ``is_scheduled`` added to Task class and it is going
  to be used in Gantt charts. Where it will lock the class and will not try
  to snap it to anywhere if it is scheduled.

* Changed the ``resolution`` attribute name to ``timing_resolution`` to comply
  with TaskJuggler.

* ScheduleMixin:
  * Updated ScheduleMixin class documentation.
  * There are two new read-only attributes called ``computed_start`` and
    ``computed_end``. These attributes will be used in storing of the values
    calculated by TaskJuggler, and will be used in Gantt Charts if available.
  * Added ``computed_duration``.
  
* Task:
  * Arranged the TaskJuggler workflow.
  * The task will use the effort > length > duration attributes in `to_tjp`
    property.

* Changed the license of Stalker from BSD-2 to LGPL 2.1. Any version previous
  to 0.2.0.a9 will be still BSD-2 and any version from and including 0.2.0.a9
  will be distributed under LGPL 2.1 license.

* Added new types of classes called Schedulers which are going to be used in
  scheduling the tasks.

* Added TaskJugglerScheduler, it uses the given project and schedules its
  tasks.

0.2.0.a8
--------

* TagSelect now can be filled by setting its ``value`` attribute (Ex:
  TagSelect.set('value', data))
  
* Fixed Projects menu in base.jinja2, the link is now updating correctly when a
  new project is added.

* Added a new method called ``is_root`` to Task class. It is true for tasks
  where there are no parents.

* Added a new attribute called ``users`` to the Department class which is a
  synonym for the ``members`` attribute.

* Task:
  * Task class is now preventing one of the dependents to be set as the parent
    of a task.
  * Task class is now preventing one of the parents to be set as the one of the
    dependents of a task.
  * Fixed ``autoflush`` bugs in Task class.

* Fixed `admin` users department initialization.

* Added ``thumbnail`` attribute to the SimpleEntity class which is a reference
  to a Link instance, showing the path of the thumbnail.

* Fixed Circular Dependency bug in Task class, where a parent of a newly
  created task is depending to another task which is set as the dependee for
  this newly created task (T1 -> T3 -> T2 -> T1 (parent relation) -> T3 -> T2
  etc.).

* jQueryGantt: Moving any child task will adjust the parent start and end dates
  so they fit to the children.

0.2.0.a7
--------

* Changed these default setting value names to corresponding new names:
  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_DURATION`` -> ``TASK_DURATION``
  * ``DEFAULT_TASK_PRIORITY`` -> ``TASK_PRIORITY``
  * ``DEFAULT_VERSION_TAKE_NAME`` -> ``VERSION_TAKE_NAME``
  * ``DEFAULT_TICKET_LABEL`` -> ``TICKET_LABEL``
  * ``DEFAULT_ACTIONS`` -> ``ACTIONS``
  * ``DEFAULT_BG_COLOR`` -> ``BG_COLOR``
  * ``DEFAULT_FG_COLOR`` -> ``FG_COLOR``

* stalker.conf.defaults:
  * Added default settings for project working hours (``WORKING_HOURS``,
    ``DAY_ORDER``, ``DAILY_WORKING_HOURS``)
  * Added a new variable for setting the task time resolution called
    ``TIME_RESOLUTION``.

* stalker.models.project.Project:
  * Removed Project.project_tasks attribute, use Project.tasks directly to get
    all the Tasks in that project. For root task you can do a quick query::
      
      Task.query.filter(Task.project==proj_id).filter(Task.parent==None).all()
    
    This will also return the Assets, Sequences and Shots in that project,
    which are also Tasks.
  
  * Users are now assigned to Projects by appending them to the Project.users
    list. This is done in this way to allow a reduced list of resources to be
    shown in the Task creation dialogs.
  
  * Added a new helper class for Project working hour management, called
    WorkingHours.
  
  * Added a new attribute to Project class called ``working_hours`` which holds
    stalker.models.project.WorkingHours instances to manage the Project working
    hours. It will directly be passed to TaskJuggler.

* stalker.models.task.Task:
  * Removed the Task.task_of attribute, use Task.parent to get the owner of
    this Task.
  
  * Task now has two new attributes called Task.parent and Task.children which
    allow more complex Task-to-Task relation.
  
  * Secondary table name for holding Task to Task dependency relation is
    renamed from ``Task_Tasks`` to ``Task_Dependencies``.
  
  * _check_circular_dependency function is now accepting a third argument which
    is the name of the attribute to be investigated for circular relationship.
    It is done in that way to be able to use the same function in searching for
    circular relations both in parent/child and depender/dependee relations.

* ScheduleMixin:
  * Added a new attribute to ScheduleMixin for time resolution adjustment.
    Default value is 1 hour and can be set with
    stalker.conf.defaults.TIME_RESOLUTION. Any finer time than the resolution
    is rounded to the closest multiply of the resolution. It is possible to set
    it from microseconds to years. Although 1 hour is a very reasonable
    resolution which is also the default resolution for TaskJuggler.
  * ScheduleMixin now uses datetime.datetime for the start and end attributes.
  * Renamed the ``start_date`` attribute to ``start``.
  * Renamed the ``end_date`` attribute to ``end``

* Removed the TaskableEntity.

* Asset, Sequence and Shot classes are now derived from Task class allowing
  more complex Task relation combined with the new parent/child relation of
  Tasks. Use Asset.children or Asset.tasks to reach the child tasks of that
  asset (same with Sequence and Shot classes).

* stalker.models.shot.Shot:
  * Removed the sequence and introduced sequences attribute in Shot class. Now
    one shot can be in more than one Sequence. Allowing more complex
    Shot/Sequence relations..
  
  * Shots can now be created without a Sequence instance. The sequence
    attribute is just used to group the Shots.
  
  * Shots now have a new attribute called ``scenes``, holding Scene instances.
    It is created to group same shots occurring in the same scenes.

* In tests all the Warnings are now properly handled as Warnings.

* stalker.models.ticket.Ticket:
  * Ticket instances are now tied to Projects and it is now possible to create
    Tickets without supplying a Version. They are free now.
  * It is now possible to link any SimpleEntity to a Ticket.
  * The Ticket Workflow is now fully customizable. Use
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_WORKFLOW dictionary to define the workflow and
    stalker.conf.defaults.TICKET_STATUS_ORDER for the order of the ticket
    statuses.

* Added a new class called ``Scene`` to manage Shots with another property.

* Removed the ``output_path`` attribute in FilenameTemplate class.

* Grouped the templates for each entity under a directory with the entity name.

* Converted the ``view.py`` to a python module and put the views for each
  entity to its own python file.

0.2.0.a6
--------

* Added a new Dojo Widget called Tag to help the creation of the tags in the
  TagSelect.

* Users now can have more than one Department.

* Updated java scripts to be `required` in Dojo AMD way.

* Updated setup.py to include "pyramid_jinja2"

* User instances now have two new properties for getting the user tickets
  (User.tickets) and the open tickets (User.open_tickets).

* New shortcut Task.project returns the Task.task_of.project value.

* Added 'PlaceHolder' property for 'FilterSelect Widgets'. And 'Label' property
  is used in construction of 'PlaceHolder' property.

* Set disabled prerequisite fields, until their prerequisite is selected.

* Added 'StartDate', 'EndDate' and 'Duration' field to add_project page.
  'StartDate', 'EndDate' properties are written on database.

* jQueryGannt:
  * Gannt view is now communicating with Stalker correctly. The only left issue
    is the end date value is not properly shown in the gannt view.
  * Updated the jQueryGannt css's to work with Stalker and Dojo.

*  Project page is redesigned. SplitContainer is removed. All contents are
   displayed in TabContainer. New Contents in TabContainer are:
    * ProjectName (Disabled Field - Used for displaying projectname.)
    * Overview  (It has InlineEditable fields. Although they are not connected
      to DB.)

* Shot and Asset creation dialogs now automatically updated with the given
  Project instance info.

* User overview page is now reflection the new design.

0.2.0.a5
--------

* The ``code`` attribute of the SimpleEntity is now introduced as a separate
  mixin. To let it be used by the classes it is really needed.

* The ``query`` method is now converted to a property so it is now possible to
  use it like a property as in the SQLAlchemy.orm.Session as shown below::
    
    from stalker import Project
    Project.query.all() # instead of Project.query().all()

* ScheduleMixin.due_date is renamed to ScheduleMixin.end_date.

* Added a new class attribute to SimpleEntity called ``__auto_name__`` which
  controls the naming of the instances and instances derived from SimpleEntity.
  If ``__auto_name__`` is set to True the ``name`` attribute of the instance
  will be automatically generated and it will have the following format::
    
    {{ClassName}}_{{UUID4}}
    
  Here are a couple of naming examples::
    
    Ticket_74bb46b0-29de-4f3e-b4e6-8bcf6aed352d
    Version_2fa5749e-8cdb-4887-aef2-6d8cec6a4faa

* Fixed an autoflush issue with SQLAlchemy in StatusList class. Now the status
  column is again not nullable in StatusMixin.

* The WebUI form fields are now refreshed with newly added data.

* Added a new Dojo widget called TagSelect. Which is basically a widget for
  adding Tag style widgets.

0.2.0.a4
--------

* Added a new class called EntityType to hold all the available class names and
  capabilities.

* Version class now has a new attribute called ``inputs`` to hold the inputs of
  the current Version instance. It is a list of Link instances.

* FilenameTemplate classes ``path`` and ``filename`` attributes are no more
  converted to string, so given a non string value will raise TypeError.

* Structure.custom_template now only accepts strings and None, setting it to
  anything else will raise a TypeError.

* Two Type's for FilenameTemplate's are created by default when initializing
  the database, first is called "Version" and it is used to define
  FilenameTemplates which are used for placing Version source files. The second
  one is called "Reference" and it is used when injecting references to a given
  class. Along with the FilenameTemplate.target_entity_type this will allow one
  to create two different FilenameTemplates for one class::
    
    # first get the Types
    vers_type = Type.query()\
                .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
                .filter_by(type="Version")\
                .first()
    
    ref_type = Type.query()\
               .filter_by(target_entity_type="FilenameTemplate")\
               .filter_by(type="Reference")\
               .first()
    
    # lets create a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Version files.
    f_ver = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=vers_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/{{task.type.code}}",
        filename="{{asset.code}}_{{version.take_name}}_{{task.type.code}}_v{{'%03d'|version.version_number}}{{link.extension}}"
        output_path="{{version.path}}/Outputs/{{version.take_name}}"
    )
    
    # and now define a FilenameTemplate for placing Asset Reference files.
    # no need to have an output_path here...
    f_ref = FilenameTemplate(
        target_entity_type="Asset",
        type=ref_type,
        path="Assets/{{asset.type.code}}/{{asset.code}}/References",
        filename="{{link.type.code}}/{{link.id}}{{link.extension}}"
    )

* stalker.db.register() now accepts only real classes instead of class names.
  This way it can store more information about classes.

* Status.bg_color and Status.fg_color attributes are now simple integers. And
  the Color class is removed.

* StatusMixin.status is now a ForeignKey to a the Statuses table, thus it is a
  real Status instance instead of an integer showing the index of the Status in
  the related StatusList. This way the Status of the object will not change if
  the content of the StatusList is changed.

* Added new attribute Project.project_tasks which holds all the direct or
  indirect Tasks created for that project.

* User.login_name is renamed to User.login.

* Removed the ``first_name``, ``last_name`` and ``initials`` attributes from
  User class. Now the ``name`` and ``code`` attributes are going to be used,
  thus the ``name`` attribute is no more the equivalent of ``login`` and the
  ``code`` attribute is doing what was ``initials`` doing previously.

0.2.0.a3
--------

* :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` class now has two new attributes
  :attr:`~stalker.models.status.Status.bg_color` and
  :attr:`~stalker.models.status.Status.fg_color` to hold the UI colors of the
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` instance. The colors are
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Color` instances.

0.2.0.a2
--------

* :class:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity` now has an attribute called
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity.generic_data` which can hold any
  kind of ``SOM`` object inside and it is a list.

* Changed the formatting rules for the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity.name` in
  :class:`~stalker.models.entity.SimpleEntity`, now it can start with a number,
  and it is not allowed to have multiple whitespace characters following each
  other.

* The ``source`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.source_file`\ .
  
* The ``version`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.version_number`\ .

* The ``take`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is renamed
  to :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.take_name`\ .

* The :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.version_number` in
  :class:`~stalker.models.version.Version` is now generated automatically if it
  is skipped or given as None or it is too low where there is already a version
  number for the same Version series (means attached to the same
  :class:`~stalker.models.task.Task` and has the same
  :attr:`~stalker.models.version.Version.take_name`).

* Moved the :class:`~stalker.models.auth.User` class to
  :mod:`~stalker.models.auth` module.

* Removed the ``stalker.ext.auth`` module because it is not necessary anymore.
  Thus the :class:`~stalker.models.auth.User` now handles all the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.auth.User.password` conversions by itself.

* ``PermissionGroup`` is renamed back to :class:`~stalker.models.auth.Group`
  again to match with the general naming of the authorization concept.

* Created two new classes for the Authorization system, first one is called
  :class:`~stalker.models.auth.Permission` and the second one is a Mixin which
  is called :class;`~stalker.models.mixins.ACLMixin` which adds ACLs to the
  mixed in class. For now, only the :class;`~stalker.models.auth.User` and
  :class;`~stalker.models.auth.Group` classes are mixed with this mixin by
  default.

* The declarative Base class of SQLAlchemy is now created by binding it to a
  ORMClass (a random name) which lets all the derived class to have a method
  called ``query`` which will bypass the need of calling
  ``DBSession.query(class_)`` but instead just call ``class_.query()``::
    
    from stalker.models.auth import User
    
    user_1 = User.query().filter_by(name='a user name').first()


0.2.0.a1
--------
* Converted the whole system to a Pyramid Web application. If the previous
  implementations investigated, it will be understood that it was only the
  database model of a Web Application.

* Changed the :meth:`~stalker.db.setup` arguments. It is now accepting a
  dictionary instead of just a string to comply with the SQLAlchemy scaffold
  and this dictionary should contain keys for the SQLAlchemy engine setup.
  There is another utility that comes with Pyramid to setup the database under
  the `scripts` folder, it is also working without any problem with
  :mod:`~stalker.db`\ .

* The ``session`` variable is renamed to ``DBSession`` and is now a scopped
  session, so there is no need to use ``DBSession.commit`` it will be handled
  by the system it self.

* Even though the ``DBSession`` is using the Zope Transaction Manager extension
  normally, in the database tests no extension is used because the transaction
  manager was swallowing all errors and it was a little weird to try to catch
  this errors out of the ``with`` block.

* Refactored the code, all the models are now in separate python files, but can
  be directly imported from the main stalker module as shown::
  
    from stalker import User, Department, Task
  
  By using this kind of organization, both development and usage will be eased
  out.

* :attr:`~stalker.models.task.Task.task_of` now only accepts
  :attr:`~stalker.models.entity.TaskableEntity` instances.

* Updated the examples. It is now showing how to extend SOM correctly. 

* Updated the references to the SOM classes in docstrings and rst files.

* Removed the ``Review`` class. And introduced the much handier
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` class. Now reviewing a data is the
  process of creating Ticket's to that data.

* The database is now initialized with a
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.StatusList` and a couple of
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status`\ es appropriate for
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` instances.

* The database is now initialized with two :class:`~stalker.models.type.Type`
  instances ('Enhancement' and 'Defect') suitable for
  :class:`~stalker.models.ticket.Ticket` instances.

* :class:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin` now stores the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status` attribute as an Integer
  showing the index of the :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` in the
  :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status_list` attribute but when
  asked for the value of :attr:`~stalker.models.mixins.StatusMixin.status`
  attribute it will return a proper :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status`
  instance and the attribute can be set with an integer or with a proper
  :class:`~stalker.models.status.Status` instance.

0.1.2.a5
--------

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity`.\ 
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.name` attribute doesn't accept
  anything other than a string or unicode anymore.
  
* All the error messages are now showing both the class and attribute names,
  and for TypeErrors it also shows the current given data type which raised
  the error and the desired type.
  
* Fixed a bug that causes recursion in queries to
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList` instances.

* Removed the ``FilenameTemplate.output_file_code`` attribute cause it is not
  needed.

* Removed the ``FilenameTemplate.output_is_relative`` attribute, now all the
  path values are :class:`~stalker.models.repository.Repository` relative.

* Renamed the ``path_code`` to ``path``, ``file_code`` to ``filename`` and
  ``output_path_code`` to ``output_path`` in
  :class:`~stalker.models.template.FilenameTemplate``\ .

0.1.2.a4
---------

* Added database tests for:
  
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Review`
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Version`
  
* The ``published`` attribute in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Version` is 
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Version.is_published`.
  
* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Structure` is not ``strictly_typed`` anymore.
  
* The initialization of ``status_list`` attribute in classes which are mixed
  with :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusMixin` is now automatically done if
  there is a database connection (stalker.db.session is not None) and there is
  a suitable :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList` instance in the database
  whom :attr:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList.target_entity_type` attribute is
  set to the mixed-in class name.

* Finished the tests for :class:`~stalker.core.models.Booking` class.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Booking` class now checks if there is more
  than one booking is creating with overlapping time interval and issue a
  :class:`~stalker.core.errors.OverBookedWarning`.

* Cleaned up the code style.

* Moved the ``target_entity_type`` functionality to a new mixin class called
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.TargetEntityTypeMixin`\ .
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList`,
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.FilenameTemplate`, and
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Type` classes are mixin with this new class.

* Included the ``pyseq`` library to the dependency list.

0.1.2.a3
---------

* stalker.__version__ is fixed for PyPI

0.1.2.a2
---------

* All the models are now converted to SQLAlchemy's Declarative.

* Because of the move to the SQLAlchemy Declarative extension the
  stalker.etx.ValidatedList is deprecated. SQLAlchemy is doing (in most of the
  aspects) a much better job.

* The ``stalker.core.mixins`` module is merged with :mod:`~stalker.core.models`
  module.

* Becase all the models are declaratively defined and thus they have their
  mappers and tables inside, the ``stalker.db.mapper``, ``stalker.db.tables``
  and the ``stalker.db.mixins`` modules are removed.

* Added the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Version` class with all its tests.

* Fixed :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.assets` and
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.sequences` attributes in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` class. It is now using the
  ``db.query`` to get the info out of the database, which is much easier than
  setting up a complex relation.

* Fixed the tests for the database. It is now working properly with the SOM
  which is using SQLAlchemy declarative. There are still missing tests though.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` and
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Structure` classes are not
  ``__strictly_typed__`` anymore. It was a bump on the road to make them
  strictly typed.

0.1.2.a1
----------

* Started to switch to SQLAlchemy ORM Declarative for SOM, implemented these
  classes successfully:
  
  SimpleEntity, Type, Tag, Note, ImageFormat, Status, StatusList, Repository,
  Structure, FilenameTemplate, Department, Link, ReferenceMixin, StatusMixin,
  ScheduleMixin, Project, Sequence, Shot, Asset, Review.

* Empty :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList`\ s are now allowed. The
  validation overhead is left to the SOM user.

* Removed the ``TaskMixin`` on the way of moving to declarative. It was not
  possible to add a one-to-many relation to the
  :class:`~stalker.core.model.Task`\ s
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.task_of` attribute from all the mixed-in
  classes. So the solution was to introduce a new
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.TaskableEntity` (yaykh!) inheriting from
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity`.

* The :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.name` attribute in
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` is no more forced to be unique.
  This releases the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Shot.name` attribute in the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class to be anything it wants (not just
  uuid4 sequences to get unique names).

* From now on, the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.code` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` class is not going to change when
  the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.name` attribute is changed.

* The :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.name` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` is going to be copied from the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.code` attribute if the ``name``
  argument is skipped, None or empty string.

* The ``ReviewMixin`` is removed.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Review` class is now inheriting from the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity`.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity` now has a new attribute called
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Entity.reviews` to store a list of
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Review` instances.

0.1.1.a10
----------

* :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` from now on doesn't have a ``tasks``
  argument in its ``__init__`` method.

* Each of the mixin classes now has their own test modules.

* In :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`, now the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Shot.cut_out` attribute is mapped to the
  database instead of the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Shot.cut_duration`.

* In :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` the ``part_of`` attribute is renamed
  to :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.task_of` to reflect its duty clearly.

* Removed the ``ProjectMixin``. The ``project`` attribute has been moved to
  the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin`. Now anything mixed with the
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` also has a 
  :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin.project` attribute.

* :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.task_of` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` class now accepts anything that has been
  derived from :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` or anything that has
  both a ``tasks`` attribute and a ``project`` attribute but use the
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` preferably.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` now doesn't accept any ``shots``
  argument. There is no way to create a :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`
  without passing a :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` instance.

* All the classes that needs to be initialized properly now has a method
  called __init_on_load__ which is called by SQLAlchemy on load.

* Fixed the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.task_of` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` and
  :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin.tasks` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin`, they are now updating each other
  correctly.

* Added :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Shot.assets` to the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class to track down which asset is used
  in this shot.

* Merged the ``ProjectMixinDB`` with ``TaskMixinDB`` and
  removed the ``ProjectMixinDB`` from the database part of the mixins.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` doesn't accept an ``assets`` nor
  a ``sequences`` arguments anymore. Which was meaningless previously, cause
  it is not possible to create an :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` or a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` without specifying the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` first.

* From now on it is not possible to create a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` instance without passing a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Repository` instance to it.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` now updates the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.assets` attribute in the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` class.

* From now on none of the tests are using the Mocker library. Thus all the
  little changes to any of the classes are present in all the tests which are
  using those classes. This makes the tests more robust and current.

* Fixed latex PDF output of the documentation, now the formatting is nice and
  correct.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Repository` now replaces backward slashes with
  forward slashes in the given path arguments and attributes.

* The ``filename`` attribute has been removed from the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Link` class. And it doesn't need an
  ``filename`` argument anymore. The :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Link.path`
  is enough to hold the necessary data.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.Link` is not strictly typed anymore. So
  you can skip the ``type`` argument while creating a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Link` instance.

* Fixed the ``Mutable Default`` problem in the following classes:
  
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Department` classes ``members`` argument.
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity` classes ``tags`` and ``notes``
    argument.
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList` classes ``statuses`` argument
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` classes ``assets`` argument
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.Assets` classes ``shots`` argument
  * :class:`~stalker.core.models.User` classes ``permission_groups``,
    ``projects_lead``, ``sequences_lead`` and tasks attributes.

* The ``milestone`` attribute is renamed to
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.is_milestone` in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` class.

* The ``complete`` attribute is renamed to
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.is_complete`` in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` class.

* Replaced the python property idiom which uses a function which contains an
  fget, an fset functions and a doc string variable and returns the result of
  locals() with the property idiom that uses @property and @x.setter. Thus
  dropped the support for python versions <= 2.5. This is done to increase the
  PyLint rate. And with its final state, the PyLint rate of Stalker increased
  from around 1 to around 9.

* Reintroduced the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin` and the
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` is now inherited from
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin`. It is done in that way to allow
  other types to have relation with a :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project`
  instance. Without the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin` it was
  going to introduce some code repetition. Also updated the database part of
  the TaskMixin and created a helper class for the ProjectMixin.

* Added an attribute called "__stalker_version__" to the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` to track down in which version of
  Stalker that data is created. This is mostly related with the database part.

* Renamed ``stalker.db.mixin`` module to :mod:`stalker.db.mixins`.

* Renamed ``stalker.core.models.Comment`` class to
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Review`.

* The :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Review.to` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Review` class now accepts anything which has a
  list-like attribute called "reviews".

* :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now works uniquely. Means
  the list of items are always unique.

* The :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin.tasks` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` is not read-only anymore. But will
  produce RuntimeError if removing items will produce orphan children.

* Optimized the back reference update procedure in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` and
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` classes. They are not touching
  their internal variables anymore.

* Fixed backreference updates of :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` classes
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.resources` attribute.

* Fixed ``__setslice__`` method in
  :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList`. It is now correctly
  passing the added and removed elements to the given ``validator`` function.

0.1.1.a9
--------

* Introduced :class:`~stalker.core.models.Type`. A new class to define
  **types**. With this introduction, all the classes deriving from
  ``TypeEntity`` (and the TypeEntity it self) are removed from Stalker.

* Added an attribute called ``type`` to the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity`. Which will be used to create new
  types to the derived classes.

* Introduced a new attribute called ``__strictly_typed__`` to all the classes
  (by the means of the EntityMeta), which will force the class to have a
  proper (not None) ``type``.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` now has its own test module.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.TypeTemplate` is renamed to
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.FilenameTemplate` to reflect its duty more
  clearly.

* fixed the tests for the :mod:`~stalker.db`. Previously each of the tests
  were creating an instance of a specific class then storing it in the
  database, retrieved it back and then comparing the instances, one just
  created and one queried from the database. The problem was that, SA was
  returning the same instance (can be checked with id(instance)) so in any
  case they were equal, it was not possible to compare them and get a
  meaningful difference to see if the database part worked properly. Now, all
  the attributes of the original instance are stored in new variables and
  then the original instance is deleted, and the a new one is retrieved back
  from the database, and all the attributes are compared with the stored ones.
  (probably there are other good ways)

* fixed :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.nice_name` in the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity`, if the instance is created by
  using ``__new__`` (like in SA) then the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.nice_name` attribute was not
  initialized correctly.

* fixed mapping of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Department.lead` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Department` class.

* fixed :attr:`~stalker.core.models.ImageFormat.device_aspect` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.ImageFormat`, it is now correctly calculated
  when the instance is created with ``__new__`` instead of ``__init__``

* fixed mapping of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.users` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` class.

* fixed mapping of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.duration` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` class (also possibly fixed all the
  classes mixed with :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin`)

* fixed mapping of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence.lead` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` class

* updated the behavior of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.users`
  attribute in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` class. Now the list of
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`\ s are gathered from the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s of the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` and from the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`\ s, 
  the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`\ s and
  the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset`\ s of the same
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project`.

* updated the behavior of :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.project` attribute
  in class :class:`~stalker.core.models.User` class. Now the list of
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project`\ s are gathered from all the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s assigned to the current
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`.

* The ``Group`` class is renamed to ``PermissionGroup``.

* The default duration for the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin`
  is now defined by the :attr:`stalker.conf.defaults.DEFAULT_TASK_DURATION`
  attribute.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin` class now accepts a third
  argument called ``duration``.

* The :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin.duration` attribute in the
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin` is now a settable. See the 
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin` class documentation for details.


* The :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin.due_date` in
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin` doesn't accept
  ``datetime.timedelta`` objects anymore.

* The behavior of :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin.start`,
  :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin.due_date` and
  :attr:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin.duration` in
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ScheduleMixin` is updated.

* Added :class:`~stalker.core.errors.CircularDependencyError`.

* All the ``ValueError``\ s are converted to ``TypeError``\ s in the
  :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList`.

* Finished the implementation of :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` class.

* Updated the formatting of the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.code`
  attribute in :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` class. See the
  documentation of the :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` class for
  details.0

* Updated the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.code` attribute in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`.

* Updated all the exceptions raised by the SOM classes. Now they are correctly
  raising ``TypeError`` and ValueError``\ s.

* added a new mixin class called :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin`.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`,
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` and :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`
  classes are now using the
  :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin` mixin class instead of
  implementing this common feature by themselfs.

* added :class:`~stalker.db.mixin.ProjectMixinDB` for classes which are mixed
  with :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ProjectMixin`.

* :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now accepts a third
  argument called the ``validator`` which should be a callable, which is
  called when any of the methods of the
  :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` is called and the list of
  elements are modified. The list of elements modified will be passed to the
  validator function where the first argument is a list containing the
  elements added and the last argument is a list contatining the elements
  removed.

* :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.resources` in
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` is now updating the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.tasks` attribute in the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.User` class.

* ``tasks`` is not an argument for the :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`
  anymore. It was meaningles to have the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s
  in the initialization of the :class:`~stalker.core.models.User` instances.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.User` classes
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.projects` attribute is now gathered by
  looking at the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.project` attribute of the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s in the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.tasks` attribute.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.StatusList` now accepts classes for the
  ``target_entity_type`` argument.

* :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ReferenceMixin` now accepts anything derived
  from the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity`.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task` class now has a
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Task.part_of` attribute which accepts
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity` instances and shows which
  entity is this task a part of.

0.1.1.a8
--------


* From now on an :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` instance can not be
  created without a :class:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType` object defining
  the type of the current :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset`. This is done to
  prevent creation of :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset`\ s without a certain
  type.

* Fixed :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` where it was not raising a
  ValueError properly for :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.sequence`,
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.assets` and
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.users` attributes when the assigned
  value is not iterable.

* Fixed :class:`~stalker.core.models.Department` where it was not raising a
  ValueError properly for :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Department.members`
  attribute when the assigned value is not iterable.

* Changed the representaion string of the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`
  to <Shot (Shot.code, Shot.code)> because the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Shot.name` is not meaningful.

* Changed the way :class:`~stalker.core.models.EntityMeta` metaclass working.
  It is now using the ``__new__`` method and the ``dict_`` of the class to
  set the attributes.

* The :class:`~stalker.core.models.EntityMeta` now adds another attribute
  called ``plural_name`` to the classes, which shows the plural form of the
  class name. By default it tries to set it to a good name using plural form
  rules of English but if the name has an irregular plural name (or it is not
  in English) you can override this attribute by adding ``plural_name`` to the
  class attributes::
    
    from stalker.core.models import SimpleEntity
    
    class MyEntity(SimpleEntity):
        plural_name = "MyEntities"
        pass

* From now on the table names are in the following format:
  
  * The plural name of the class if the table belongs to one class
  * The class1.__name__ + "_" + class2.plural_name if the table is a join
    table

* Updated the table names in the :mod:`stalker.db.mixin` module

0.1.1.a7
--------

* Updated the :ref:`roadmap_toplevel` to reflect the current development
  history and cycle

* Merged all the model classes which were previously in separate files in to
  :mod:`stalker.core.models` module, to make it easy to use (and possibly hard
  to develop)

* All the references to modules or classes or anything in the source codes are
  now represented by an absolute path in the docs (
  :class:`stalker.core.models.User` instead of
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.User`)

* moved the :mod:`stalker.db.auth` to :mod:`stalker.ext.auth`

* :class:`stalker.core.models.User` class now uses the
  :func:`stalker.ext.auth.set_password` and
  :func:`stalker.ext.auth.check_password` utility functions to handle
  passwords. The user passwords are now always hidden, but not strongly
  encrypted.

* The :func:`stalker.ext.auth.session` renamed to
  :func:`stalker.ext.auth.create_session` to reflect its functionality
  properly. And removed the return value from the function. Now it doesn't
  return any bool value but None. To check if the user is already logged in
  use :const:`stalker.ext.auth.SESSION` dictionary as follows::
  
    from stalker.ext import auth
    
    # initialize the session
    auth.create_session()
    
    # check if there is a user
    if auth.SESSION_KEY in auth.SESSION:
        print "There is a logged in user"
    else:
        print "There is no logged in user"

* :func:`stalker.ext.auth.authenticate` updated to use
  :func:`stalker.ext.auth.check_password`

* Fixed the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.User.last_login` attribute in the
  database mapper, it was set as a *synonym* for it self.

* Removed the ``tearDown`` methods in :mod:`tests.db.test_db`, there are
  problems with cleaning the mappers and disposing the engine, so instead of
  killing them the db.setup is called over and over again with different in
  memory databases.

* From now on the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.SimpleEntity.code` attribute
  doesn't format the given string value too heavily, to allow more individual
  naming conventions to work with Stalker.

* Updated :ref:`contribute_toplevel`

* Renamed the :class:`~stalker.core.models.PipelineStep` to
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.TaskType` and changed the idea behind the
  relation between :class:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType` and
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`

* :class:`stalker.core.models.AssetType` classes
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType.pipeline_steps` attribute has been
  renamed to :attr:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType.task_types`

* Fixed a little error in the mapper of :class:`stalker.core.models.Structure`

* Re-implemented the :func:`stalker.ext.auth.login` function and updated the
  tests accordingly.

* All the error classes in :mod:`stalker.core.models` moved to
  :mod:`stalker.core.errors`

* Added a new error class called :class:`stalker.core.errors.DBError`

* Fixed a bug in :const:`stalker.db.__mappers__`, it is now possible to add
  new mappers without deleting the previous
  :const:`stalker.conf.defaults.MAPPERS` list.

* Removed the :class:`~stalker.core.models.AssetType` and derived the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` and :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset`
  classes from :class:`~stalker.core.models.Entity`.

* Moved the mixin classes from :mod:`stalker.core.models` to
  :mod:`stalker.core.mixins`

* Introduced the :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.TaskMixin` which gives the
  ability to connect a list of tasks to the mixed in class. Also added the
  mapper setup for this mixin.

* :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now accepts string values
  for the ``type_`` argument.

* Added :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class and test for it.

* Updated the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` database tests according
  to new rules introduced with the :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class.

* :class:`~stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` now imports the given
  types lazily when the type is given as a string path.

* :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` now needs a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` instance to be created.

* It is now possible to assign :class:`~stalker.core.models.Task`\ s to
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` and
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`\ s. Also updated the tests for this
  change.

* Removed the ``shots`` argument from the
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` class initialization. Because there
  is no way to create a :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` without a
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence` instance.

* Added tests for mixin initialization for
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project`,
  :class:`~stalker.core.models.Sequence`, :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot`
  and :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` classes.

* Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` where it was always
  initializing the references with an empty list no matter what is given.

* Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` where it was always
  initializing the :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Project.start` to
  **datetime.date.today** and the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.project.due_date` to 10 days later then the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.project.start` no matter what are given.

* Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.mixins.ReferenceMixin` where it was not
  initializing the reference attribute correctly.

* Fixed a bug in :class:`~stalker.core.models.Asset` where the
  :attr:`~stalker.core.models.Asset.project` attribute was not correctly
  getting the given :class:`~stalker.core.models.Project` instance.

* Added the mappers and tables for :class:`~stalker.core.models.Shot` class.

* Updated database model tests to test all the attributes of the models.

0.1.1.a6
--------

* updated/fixed tests for :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList`

* updated a couple of tests to increase tests coverage

* :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status` class instances now can be
  compared to string or unicode values

* A :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status` object in a
  :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` can now be accessed by its
  name as the index in :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` only
  while getting the item.

* Added :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ScheduleMixin` which introduces date
  variables like, start, due_date and duration to the mixed in class.

* Removed some parts of the :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class
  which are now satisfied by the
  :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ScheduleMixin`

* Improved the implementation of the :mod:`stalker.db.auth` module

* removed the ``stalker.db.__setup__`` module which were helping to reference
  the variables in :mod:`stalker.db` module but it is not needed any more

* It is now possible to initialize a
  :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` object without a
  :class:`stalker.core.models.repository.Repository`,
  :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure` or an
  :class:`stalker.core.models.imageFormat.ImageFormat` or a
  :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

* Updated the :ref:`tutorial_toplevel`

* From now on, in a :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity`,
  setting the code attribute to None or empty string will not raise any
  ``ValueError``\ s but will re-initialize the ``code`` value from the
  ``nice_name`` attribute.

* Implemented :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence` class along with
  its tests.

* added :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence` equality tests.

* improved :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` equality tests.

* Implemented :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase` class along
  with its tests.

* The **index.rst** of the documentation now references the **README** from
  the project root.

* added the basic implementation of :class:`stalker.core.models.task.Task`
  and :class:`stalker.core.models.shot.Shot` and mapped them very basically
  to be able to test the dependent classes like
  :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase` and
  :class:`stalker.core.models.sequence.Sequence`

* Added mappers and tables for
  :class:`stalker.core.models.assetBase.AssetBase`

* Now all the mixin classes have proper :func:`__init__` methods, and in a
  mixed class, the mixin classes' :func:`__init__` method can be called
  directly by giving the current object instance (*self*) like shown below::
    
    class ANewEntity(entity.SimpleEntity, mixin.StatusMixin):
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super(ANewEntity, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            mixin.StatusMixin.__init__(self, **kwargs)
  
  and it can be repeated for any number of mixins in class inheritance path.

* Added the **CHANGELOG** to the documentation, and updated all formating of
  the mentioned references inside the file.

0.1.1.a5
--------

* removed the :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity` and its
  tests, with the introduction of
  :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin`, it is not necessary any
  more

* added camera_lens.py to the examples, which shows how to extend SOM in its
  very basic form, also added tests testing this example

* changed the database uri for the **DatabaseTester**, it now uses an in
  memory SQLite database instead a file based one.

* Updated the version numbers in the roadmap

* Added ``last_login`` attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`
  class tables and mapped it

* because it was taking too much space in the diffs the VUE file which shows
  the design sketches has been removed from the trunk

* added the :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` class which is a
  list derivative that accepts only one type of object.

* these SOM classes listed below uses
  :class:`stalker.ext.validatedList.ValidatedList` in their list attributes
  requiring specific types of objects to be assigned:
  
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.Entity`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.department.Department`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`

* added tests of the :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class

* completed the first implementation of the
  :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project` class

* to be able to use *assertIsInstance* method of
  :class:`mocker.MockerTestCase` all the
  :class:`unittest.TestCase` test classes are converted to
  :class:`mocker.MockerTestCase`

* changed the design of the **stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup**
  and **stalker.db.mixins.StatusMixin.setup** to organize the mixin
  classes' database setup helper functions, now they are converted to classes
  with a classmethod called :meth:`stalker.db.mixin.ReferenceMixinDB.setup`
  doing all the functionality of the previous setup function and placed them
  under the :mod:`stalker.db.mixin` module.

* added persistence tests for :class:`stalker.core.models.project.Project`

* fixed secondary table generation for
  :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`, the table is now
  created only if it doesn't exists already, and it is retrieved from
  :attr:`stalker.db.metadata` if it exists

0.1.1.a4
--------

* changed the arguments of the
  :func:`stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup` function, to allow
  carrying the data from one to the next mixin (this part still needs a lot of
  attention)

* removed the unnecessary ``statusedEntity_statuses`` secondary table, because
  one :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity` owns just one
  :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` its a **many2one** relation,
  so no need to have a secondary table

* introduced the :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin` (will replace
  StatusedEntity soon)

* Added a new example for the usage of
  :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.StatusMixin`

* Updated the :func:`stalker.db.mixins.ReferenceMixin.setup` function, now it
  takes three arguments, the *class*, the *table* and the *mapper_options*
  dictionary.

0.1.1.a3
--------

* Removed the included *tests* from the egg build

* Added/fixed equality and inequality operators for classes:

  * :class:`stalker.core.models.department.Department`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity`

* :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` now has a \*\*kwargs in the
  :func:`__init__` so it doesn't give ``TypeError`` for extra keywords

* added :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.EntityMeta` metaclass which adds
  ``entity_type`` attribute and sets its value to the unicode version of the
  name of the class

* the :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` uses the
  :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.EntityMeta` metaclass to automatically
  add all the ``entity_type`` attribute to all the derived classes

* all the mappers now uses the ``ClassName.entity_type`` class attribute as
  the polymorphic discriminator (polymorphic identity)

* instead of *LBYL* moving toward *EAFP* idiom for all the models in the
  :mod:`stalker.core`

* :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` now supports indexing

* :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList` now has an
  ``target_entity_type`` attribute which accepts strings with the class name
  and shows the compatible class of this
  :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`

* :meth:`stakler.core.models.status.StatusList.__eq__` now checks for the
  ``target_entity_type`` also

* :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusedEntity` now checks for the given
  :attr:`stalker.core.models.StatusList.target_entity_type` for
  compatibility with the current class

* All the validation methods in the :mod:`stalker.core.models` now has the
  **validate** word in their name instead of **check**

* Little fixes:
  
  * the mapper of :class:`stalker.core.models.types.TypeTemplate` was trying
     to setup a synonym to a parameter with the same name (file_code)
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` classes ``_sequence_lead``
       attribute renamed to ``_sequences_lead``

* Added persistence tests for
  :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.StatusedEntity`

* Added :func:`stalker.utils.path_to_exec` which converts the given module
  full paths to an executable python code which imports the given python
  object to the current namespace

* Added ``entity_types`` table to hold the possible entity types in Stalker.
  The content of the table comes from the
  :const:`stalker.conf.defaults.CORE_MODEL_CLASSES` list. And possibly going
  to be extended by the users.

* Added :func:`stalker.db.__setup__.__fill_entity_types_table__` which fills
  the ``entity_types`` table with default values.

* :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class now has ``initials`` attribute,
  which is automatically calculated from the first and last name if there is
  no one given.

* Started developing the :class:`stalker.core.models.message.Message` class

* Added the :mod:`stalker.core.models.mixin` module which holds the common
  mixins.

* Added the :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin` class which
  gives reference abilities to mixed in classes.

* Added the database part of the
  :class:`stalker.core.models.mixin.ReferenceMixin`. Now it is possible to
  create a new type of entity and mix it with ReferenceMixin and also persist
  it in the database. But it needs a lot of effort before to have something
  usable.

* Added **examples** module, which holds usage examples and recipes

* Added an example about how to create a new mixed in entity type for SOM.

0.1.1.a2
--------

* Updated the Tutorial

* Added *code* attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity`

* Updated the :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class for the new *code*
  attribute, and also updated the tests to add tests for *code* attribute
  (simply copied the test code from ``SimpleEntityTester``, bad code
  repetition, need to change it later, by may be inheriting the test case from
  the other one)

* Updated the database tables and mappers for the new *code* attribute

* Removed the clashing *code* attribute from
  :class:`stalker.core.models.pipelineStep.PipelineStep` class and the tables
  and mappers.

* Added :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note` class

* Added ``notes`` table and a mapper for
  :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note` class

* Added *note* attribute to :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.Entity` class

* Fixed ``EntityTester`` in tests

* Added ``__repr__`` to entity classes

* Added tests for persistence of :class:`stalker.core.models.note.Note`` class

* Added equality (__eq__) and inequality (__ne__) operators for classes:
  
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.tag.Tag`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.Status`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.status.StatusList`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.imageFormat.ImageFormat`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.repository.Repository`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.pipelineStep.PipelineStep`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.LinkType`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.TypeEntity`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

* :class:`stalker.core.models.Status` classes' short_name attribute has been
  removed, from now on the ``code`` attribute will be used, also updated the
  database tables and mappers

* The :attr:`stalker.core.models.user.User.login_name` is now superior to the
  :attr:`stalker.core.models.user.User.name` attribute, giving both of them as
  arguments will lead the ``login_name`` to be used as both the ``login_name``
  and the ``name``

0.1.1.a1
--------

* Fixed a couple of documentation errors like:
  
  * :ref:`inheritance_diagram_toplevel` had references to modules
  * A couple of docstring documentation errors in
     :class:`stalker.core.models.structure.Structure`,
     :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` and
     :class:`stalker.core.models.types.TypeTemplate` classes
  
* Updated :ref:`installation_toplevel`

* Added :ref:`tutorial_toplevel` page to the documentation

* All the classes, functions from **SQLAlchemy** are now imported to the
  ``sqlalchemy`` namespace, this will let the **Sphinx** to correctly include
  classes, functions from **Stalker** only

* Removed the ``db.meta module``, now all the functionalities supplied by
  ``stalker.db.meta`` are supplied by ``db`` itself (``db.meta.session`` -->
  ``db.session`` etc.)

* Added ``query`` variable to :mod:`stalker.db` module so instead of
  ``db.session.query`` now ``db.query`` can be used

* Updated :func:`stalker.db.auth.login_required` decorator function, it now
  accepts a ``view`` function

* Added :func:`stalker.db.auth.permission_required` decorator function

* ``name`` attribute of :class:`stalker.core.models.entity.SimpleEntity` is
  not any more forced to start with an upper case letter

* From now on ``login_name`` is now a *synonym* for ``name`` in
  :class:`stalker.core.models.user.User` class and just the ``name`` attribute
  is going to be stored in the database

* To make things simple all the properties with name **type_** is now using
  the name **type** even though it is a Python keyword, Python is clever
  enough to understand what is meant

  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.AssetType`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.LinkType`
  * :class:`stalker.core.models.types.ProjectType`

* Updated ``simpleEntities`` table, now the ``name`` by itself is not a
  *unique constraint*, but added an explicit ``UniqueConstraint`` on ``name``
  and ``entity_type`` columns to allow entities with different types to have
  the same name, also added test for that.

* Fixed all the errors in ``test_db.py``, there are only failures left.

* Added tests for :class:`stalker.core.models.link.Link`, all the test are

* re-introduced the link.Link, which has a general meaning than
  reference.Reference (I bet it will be reference again tomorrow)

  previous design.

* reorganized the AssetType and ReferenceType objects by introducing the new
  TypeEntity class and deriving the AssetType and ReferenceType from this
  class

* added ProjectType class to hold different project types (like Commercial,
  Film, Still etc., it is different than having a Commercial Structure object)

0.0.1.20101227
--------------

* the test_db is converted to a proper unittest which is testing all the
  models one by one

* test/db renamed to test/z_db to let nose run it latest to solve the problem
  about mocker and sqlalchemy fighting each other.

  any time

* started adding tests for every class in SOM

0.0.1.20101226
--------------

* in user.User the last_name attribute could be an empty string

* removed SimpleEntity, TaggedEntity and introduced StatusedEntity to make the
  inheritance clear and let users to find somebody to blame by moving all the
  audit information to the the SimpleEntity class in which everything is

  * a database entry point
  * a customizable object model and database tables
  * an automatic mapper to map the objects and tables together according to
     user settings
  
  things can change a lot in this phase, I'm just trying to figure out the
  best possible way to do it.
  
* added a new entity type called TaggedEntity which derives from SimpleEntity,
  and moved all the tag related attributes of SimpleEntity to TaggedEntity,
  and all the child classes deriving from SimpleEntity now derives from
  TaggedEntity, also moved the tests related with tag in SimpleEntity to
  TaggedEntity.

* tag.Tag now derives from the SimpleEntity and doesn't add any other
  attribute to its super.
