Conclusion
==========

In this tutorial, you have nearly learned a quarter of what Stalker supplies as
a Python library.

Stalker provides a robust framework for production asset management, serving
the needs of both large and small studios. Its 16-years development history (as
of 2025) and use in major feature films and countless commercials is a
testament to its effectiveness.

While Stalker itself lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), its power extends
beyond raw code. Here are some additional tools that leverage Stalker's core
functionality:

`Stalker Pyramid`_:

    A web application built using the `Pyramid`_ framework, utilizing Stalker
    as its database model. This allows for user-friendly web-based interaction
    with project data.

`Anima Pipeline`_:

    A pipeline library that incorporates Stalker, showcasing how its
    functionalities can be integrated into a pipeline management system.
    Notably, Anima demonstrates the creation of Qt UIs using Stalker.

For a deeper dive into how Stalker interacts with UIs and web applications,
consider exploring the repositories of `Stalker Pyramid`_ and
`Anima Pipeline`_.

By understanding how Stalker integrates with these tools, you can unlock its
full potential for streamlining your production workflows.
