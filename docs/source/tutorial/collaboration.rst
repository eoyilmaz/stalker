Collaboration in Stalker
========================

While we've covered the core functionalities of Stalker, effective
collaboration is essential in any production pipeline. Stalker provides several
tools to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among team members.

Note System:

    You can leave :class:`Note`\ s on any Stalker :class:`.Entity` (except
    other :class:`.Note`\ s and :class:`.Tag`\ s). This allows you to add
    comments, reminders, or specific instructions to tasks, assets, versions,
    and other objects.

Messaging System:

    A direct messaging system (currently under development) will allow you to
    send private messages to individuals or groups of users.

Ticket System:

    Create and track tickets for specific projects to report issues, request
    features, or discuss project-related matters.

Wiki Pages:

    Create and maintain project-specific wiki pages to document procedures,
    best practices, and other important information.
