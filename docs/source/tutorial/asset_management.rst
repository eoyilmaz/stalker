Asset Management
================

Now that we've created projects, tasks and resources, it's time to manage the
files generated during production.

File Storage and Repository setup
---------------------------------

Contrary to a Source Code Management (SCM) System where revisions to a file is
handled incrementally, Stalker handles file versions all together. Meaning
that, all the files (:class:`.File`) that are created for individual versions
(:class:`.Version`) of a task are individual files stored in a shared location
accessible to everyone in your studio. This location is called a
:class:`.Repository` in Stalker.

Defining Repository Paths
-------------------------

A repository can be a network share or a locally mounted directory. You can
define multiple repositories for different project types or needs. We've
already created a repository while creating our first project. But the
repository has missing information. Here's how to define paths for a commercial
project repository::

.. code-block:: python

    commercial_repo.linux_path   = "/mnt/M/commercials"
    commercial_repo.macos_path   = "/Volumes/M/commercials"
    commercial_repo.windows_path = "M:/commercials"
    # Stalker automatically corrects backslashes (\) to forward slashes (/)

And if you ask for the path to a repository object, it will always return the
correct path according to your operating system:

.. code-block:: python

    print(commercial_repo.path)

You'll get the appropriate path based on your OS:

* **Windows:** M:/commercials
* **Linux:** /mnt/M/commercials
* **macOS:** /Volumes/M/commercials

This ensures consistent file path handling across different platforms.

.. note::

  Stalker consistently uses forward slashes (/) in path definitions, regardless
  of the operating system. This applies even if you initially specify paths
  with backward slashes (\\).


Assigning Repository to Project
-------------------------------

Connecting a repository to your project lets Stalker know where project files
are stored. However, it still needs information about the project's specific
directory structure.

Defining Project Structure
--------------------------

A :class:`.Structure` object defines the directory hierarchy for your project
within the repository. We create a structure named "Commercial Projects
Structure" and assign it to our project:

.. code-block:: python

    from stalker import Structure

    commercial_project_structure = Structure(
        name="Commercial Projects Structure"
    )

    # now assign this structure to our project
    new_project.structure = commercial_project_structure

.. versionadded:: 0.2.13

   Starting with Stalker version 0.2.13, :class:`.Project` instances can be
   associated with multiple :class:`.Repository` instances. This allows for
   more flexible file management, such as storing published version files on a
   separate server or directing rendered outputs to a different location.

   While the following examples are simplified, future versions will showcase
   the full potential of multiple repositories.

Creating Filename Templates
---------------------------

Next we create :class:`.FilenameTemplate` instances. These templates define how
filenames and paths will be generated for by :class:`.Version` instances
associated with tasks.

Here, we create a :class:`.FilenameTemplate` named "Task Template for
Commercials" that uses `Jinja2`_ syntax for the ``path`` and ``filename``
arguments. The :class:`.Version.generate_path()` method knows how to render
these templates to generate a ``pathlib.Path`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    from stalker import FilenameTemplate

    task_template = FilenameTemplate(
        name='Task Template for Commercials',
        target_entity_type='Task',
        path='$REPO{{project.repository.code}}/{{project.code}}/{%- for p in parent_tasks -%}{{p.nice_name}}/{%- endfor -%}',
        filename='{{version.nice_name}}_r{{"%02d"|format(version.revision_number)}}_v{{"%03d"|format(version.version_number)}}'
    )

  # Append the template to the project structure
  commercial_project_structure.templates.append(task_template)

  # No need to add anything as the project is already in the database
  DBsession.commit()

Explanation of the Template:

* ``$REPO{{project.repository.code}}``: This references the first repository
  assigned to the project. Importantly, this uses an environment variable
  ``$REPO``. Stalker dynamically creates environment variables for each
  repository upon database connection or creation, simplifying path definitions
  within templates.

* ``{{project.code}}``: This represent the project code and it is guaranteed to
  be file system safe.

* ``{%- for p in parent_tasks -%}{{p.nice_name}}/{%- endfor -%}``: This loop
  iterates over parent tasks, creating subdirectories for each.

* ``{{version.nice_name}}_r{{"%02d"|format(version.revision_number)}}_v{{"%03d"|format(version.version_number)}}``: This
  defines the filename format with revision and version numbers padded.

Creating and Managing Versions
------------------------------

Now, let's create a :class:`.Version`` instance for the "comp" task:

.. code-block:: python

    from stalker import Version

    vers1 = Version(task=comp)

    # Generate a path using the template
    path = vers1.generate_path()

    print(path.parent)  # '$REPO33/FC/SH001/comp'
    print(path.name)    # 'SH001_comp_r01_v001'
    print(path)         # '$REPO33/FC/SH001/comp/SH001_comp_r01_v001'

    # Absolute paths with repository root based on your OS
    # unfortunately the Path object doesn't directly render environment variables
    print(os.path.expandvars(path.parent))       # '/mnt/M/commercials/FC/SH001/comp'
    print(os.path.expandvars(path))  # '/mnt/M/commercials/FC/SH001/comp/SH001_comp_r01_v001'

    # Get the revision number (manually incremented)
    print(vers1.revision_number)      # 1

    # Get version number (automatically incremented)
    print(vers1.version_number)      # 1

    # commit to database
    DBsession.commit()

Stalker automatically generates a consistent path and filename for the version
based on the template.

Stalker eliminates the need for those cumbersome and confusing file naming
conventions like ``Shot1_comp_Final``, ``Shot1_comp_Final_revised``,
``Shot1_comp_Final_revised_Final``,
``Shot1_comp_Final_revised_Final_real_final`` ...and the list goes on,
we've all experienced the frustration of such naming conventions, haven't we
ðŸ˜Š.. It ensures a consistent and organized file structure, making asset
management significantly more efficient.

The :attr:`.Version.is_published` attribute within the :class:`.Version` class
helps differentiate between finalized and in-progress versions. Setting
:attr:`.is_published` to ``True`` flags a version as ready for use or review.

.. code-block:: python

    vers1.is_published = False  # This version is still being worked on

Automatic Version Numbering
---------------------------

Stalker automatically increments version numbers for each new version created
for the same task. This ensures you always have the latest iteration readily
identified.

.. code-block:: python

    vers2 = Version(task=comp)
    print(vers2.version_number)        # Output: 2
    print(vers2.generate_path().name)  # Output: 'SH001_comp_r01_v002'

    vers3 = Version(task=comp)
    print(vers3.version_number)        # Output: 3
    print(vers3.generate_path().name)  # Output: 'SH001_comp_r01_v003'

:attr:`.Version.revision_number` is not updated automatically and left for the
user to update:

.. code-block:: python

    vers4 = Version(task=comp, revision_number=2)
    print(vers4.version_number)        # Output: 4
    print(vers4.generate_path().name)  # Output: 'SH001_comp_r02_v001'

Querying Versions
-----------------

You can retrieve all versions associated with a specific task using either
using the :attr:`.Task.versions` attribute or by doing a database query.

.. code-block:: python

    # using pure Python
    vers_from_python = comp.versions
    # [<FC_SH001_comp_r01_v001 (Version)>,
    #  <FC_SH001_comp_r01_v002 (Version)>,
    #  <FC_SH001_comp_r01_v003 (Version)>]

    # # Using SQLAlchemy query
    vers_from_query = Version.query.filter_by(task=comp).all()

    # again returns
    # [<FC_SH001_comp_r01_v001 (Version)>,
    #  <FC_SH001_comp_r01_v002 (Version)>,
    #  <FC_SH001_comp_r01_v003 (Version)>]

    # Both methods return a list of Version objects
    assert vers_from_python == vers_from_query

.. _Jinja2: http://jinja.pocoo.org/

.. note::

   Files related to :class:`.Version` instances can be created by instantiating
   the :class:`.File` class. The :attr:`.File.full_path` can be set with the
   value coming from the :meth:`.Version.generate_path()` method, which by
   default will contain environment variables for the repository path and
   Stalker will save the :att:`.File.full_path` attribute value in the database
   without converting the environment variables so the paths will stay
   operating system independent.

You can define default directories within your project structure using custom
templates.

.. code-block:: python

    commercial_project_structure.custom_template = """
    Temp
    References
    References/Movies
    References/Images
    """

When executed, this template will generate the following directory structure:

.. code-block:: shell

    Temp
    References
        Movies
        Images
