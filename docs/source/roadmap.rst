Stalker Development Roadmap
===========================

This section describes the direction Stalker is going.

Roadmap Based on Versions
=========================

Below you can find the roadmap based on the version

0.1.2:
------

 * A complete working set of models in SOM which are using
   SQLAlchemy.ext.declarative.

0.2.0:
------
 * Interactions with host programs (MAYA, NUKE, HOUDINI etc.)
 * PySide interfaces

0.3.0:
------
 * Web interface
 * Complete ProdAM capabilities.
 * And new features that I can't really see right now.
 * Maybe mobile versions for Android and iPhone/iPad (though the Web interface
   should work flawlessly for them)
