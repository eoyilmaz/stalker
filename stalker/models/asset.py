    """The Asset class is the whole idea behind Stalker.

    *Assets* are containers of :class:`.Task` s. And :class:`.Task` s are the
    smallest meaningful part that should be accomplished to complete the
    :class:`.Project`.

    An example could be given as follows; you can create an asset for one of
    the characters in your project. Than you can divide this character asset in
    to :class:`.Task` s. These :class:`.Task` s can be defined by the type of
    the :class:`.Asset`, which is a :class:`.Type` object created specifically
    for :class:`.Asset` (ie. has its :attr:`.Type.target_entity_type` set to
    "Asset"),

    An :class:`.Asset` instance should be initialized with a :class:`.Project`
    instance (as the other classes which are mixed with the
    :class:`.TaskMixin`). And when a :class:`.Project` instance is given then
    the asset will append itself to the :attr:`.Project.assets` list.

    ..versionadded: 0.2.0:
        No more Asset to Shot connection:

        Assets now are not directly related to Shots. Instead a
        :class:`.Version` will reference the Asset and then it is easy to track
        which shots are referencing this Asset by querying with a join of Shot
        Versions referencing this Asset.
